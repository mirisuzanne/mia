You can't start working
until you know what you are working towards.
That doesn't mean knowing all the answers,
it means knowing the questions that will guide you.

I refer to those guiding questions as
the "seed" of a project.

[This is *part 4* in the ongoing
[Fuck the Muse](/2012/10/16/muse-intro/) series.]


## A Range of Specimen

There are many ways to find,
define, and refine your seed.
`The LIDA Project`_
borrows from `Scientific Method`_,
starting with a question and related hypothesis.

.. _The LIDA Project: http://lida.org/
.. _Scientific Method: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method

1. Formulate a *question*
2. Do *background research*
3. Construct a *hypothesis*

`Simon Sinek`_ starts his projects with
"why" then "how" and finally "what" -
statements of belief, values, and finally product.

.. _Simon Sinek: http://startwithwhy.com/

`Anne Bogart`_ covers similar territory
with her three-part seed:

.. _Anne Bogart: http://www.siti.org/

1. What is the *question* that motivates the piece?
2. Who or what is the *anchor* through which we explore the question?
3. What is the *structure* of our exploration?

These are all variations on finding a seed.
It doesn't have to be a formal process,
but it helps to know more-or-less what you need
in order to move forward.

My seeds usually start with a single idea
floating around in my mind
until other ideas attach themselves.
Once the parts begin to gel,
I know it's time to pay closer attention.
In the end,
I have a list similar to Anne's
before I move to the next step.


A Seed of My Own
================

One of my current projects-in-development
started with a quote I found on the internet
(from `The Invention of Heterosexuality`_
by Jonathan Ned Katz):

  We name and speak of a troublesome ‘transsexualism,’ the feeling of being the other sex… We do not name and talk much about the feeling of being the same sex—the sex we think we are, the sex most of us desire to stay. But does not our feeling relatively comfortable with our sex, and our intense desire to maintain the integrity of our sex, indicate something that needs to be explained?

.. _The Invention of Heterosexuality: http://books.google.com/books?id=S8BB1K361SUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false

|science|

I combined that with an article
describing the `science of out-of-body experience`_.
It raised some questions for me:

.. _science of out-of-body experience: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=real-outof-body-experiences

- How do we relate to these bodies we live in?
- What does it mean to identify with a body, let alone a sex or gender?
- How are trauma and memory involved?

Those *questions* became the motivating "*why*" of the project.
With a little *background research*
(I used `Wikipedia`_, `Google`_, and `my local bookstore`_),
the other pieces fell into place.

The fragmented & unreliable nature of memory inspired a *structure*:
note cards, each written as a fragment of memory,
and then shuffled before reading.

The *anchor* is a mashup of several existing characters and places
taken from history, mythology and song:
The transformation of `Hermaphroditus`_,
`Mother Clap`_'s 18th-century `Molly Houses`_,
and the songs of `Tom Waits`_ & `Lou`_ `Reed`_.

.. _Hermaphroditus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphroditos
.. _Mother Clap: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Clap
.. _Molly Houses: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_house
.. _Tom Waits: http://rd.io/x/QFp1K1LvjA
.. _Lou: http://rd.io/x/QFp1KzMxvg
.. _Reed: http://rd.io/x/QFp1K2_sfw


DIYourself
==========

The goal isn't to do it exactly the way I do it,
or the way LIDA, Anne Bogart, or Simon Sinek do it.
The goal is to know what you need,
and then pay attention to how you get there.

De-mystify the process,
then learn to repeat it.
