Middle Meyer
============

This is step 2 in a `continued effort`_
to differentiate myself from the other `Eric A Meyer`_.
Last week I took on *Suzanne* as a new middle name.
This week I get *Meyer* out of the way,
by flipping middle name with last initial.

*Eric M Suzanne* or simply *Eric Suzanne*

As part of the transition,
I'm moving this website URL to
`ericsuzanne.com <http://ericsuzanne.com>`_.
Old links pointing to `andmeyer.com <http://andmeyer.com>`_
should continue to work for the time being.

Step 3 is to publish more work under my new name.
There is no step 4.
