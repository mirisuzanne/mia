  2013 was nutsâ€¦


2013
====

I presented (for the first time) at conferences
on both art & technology,
thanks to invitations from
the `Media Archelology Lab`_,
`The Brakhage Center`_,
and `SassConf`_.
I re-wrote `Susy`_ from the ground up,
with help & inspiration from people like
`Tsachi Schlidor`_, `Aaron Gray`_, `Scott Kellum`_, and `Sam Richards`_.
I met and had the opportunity to work with some of my internet heros,
like `Jina Bolton`_ & `Rachel Nabors`_.
I co-founded (with Aaron) a `Sass Meetup`_ in Denver,
and we've been overwhelmed by the great response and new friends.
`SpringGun Press`_ picked up one of my novels
(which will be out by this time next year),
and I'm talking with a publisher about
the future of `Into The Green Green Mud`_.

2014 looks like more of the same.
Bring it on.
