summary: |
  A `Screw Tooth`_ installation & performance
  built from the prophetic 1982 science-fiction/horror movie,
  “Forbidden World,”
  filtered through the mind of an obsessive,
  self-proclaimed prophet.
  Created by Adam Stone & Erin Rollman
  at Buntport Theatre,
  with contributions from myself and many others (August 8-9, 2014).
