summary: |
  `The Obsolete Book in a Post-Obsolete World as Represented by an Obsolete Book About Dance`_
  is a reflection on the obsolescence of obsolescence,
  and a performable website in the spirit of `Michelle Ellsworth`_.
  This summer it also became a gallery installation,
  when I was invited to install & perform
  in the `Electronic Literature Organization`_ conference gallery.

the video below on YouTube.

Thanks for keeping the obsolete book alive!
