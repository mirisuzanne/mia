It’s the third Saturday in October,
which everyone knows is
“Announce Your New Name/Gender —
If You Were `Once Called`_ Eric A Meyer,
But Not `The One Who Wrote The CSS Reset`_,
The Other One, You Know — Day”.
It’s a long title for a little-celebrated holiday,
but it’s important to some of us (me).

To commemorate the moment,
I’ve expanded that previously un-defined “M”
that’s been hanging out in the middle of my name —
now “Miriam Eric Suzanne” —
with “Miriam” as the colloquial,
and moved my site to `miriamsuzanne.com`_.

Miriam Suzanne is the name
my parents had picked out for me
33-odd years ago,
and forgot to apply.
It's never too late.
Thanks Mom! Thanks Dad!

If you thought I was out a long time ago,
you're not entirely wrong —
but sometimes a slow process
requires the occasional re-fresh.
If you are surprised and confused,
so am I —
maybe we'll get through this together?
If you are interested in some highlights from
my `summer-of-trans* reading list`_,
I made it available online
(and I'm always open to more suggestions).
Happy queerness!
