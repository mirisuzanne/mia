    Mother finds me at her wardrobe, in her pumps and pearls.
    *What are you doing?*
    Being a mommy.
    *Are you, then?*
    She clips on the earrings (they pinch!),
    reaches for her lipstick.

Twined Fragments is an ongoing collaboration
between authors **Miriam Suzanne** and `Allison Washington`_.
Each fragment is sparked by the previous,
as trans women of different generations
pass their memories back and forth,
reflecting on lives and transitions separated by a quarter-century.

Working through these fragments of reflection
lets us touch on moments and emotions
that are sometimes too painful to interrogate deeply.
In conversation, we do together what we could not alone.
The result leaves us with more questions than answers,
and we love that.
