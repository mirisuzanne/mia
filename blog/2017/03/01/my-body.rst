  I wasn't born in the wrong body.
  *I was born, a body.*
  Without my body, I don't exist.


Body & Gender Fragments
=======================

Some ``bodies have freckles,``
while some are six-foot-four and near-sighted.
Some grow thick hair,
``while`` others have autism.
Each body comes with a unique mix of experiences —
affordances and constraints.
This body isn't wrong,
it's trans.
``My genitals don't`` match my gender,
the way some bodies do.

You might need help with insulin.
``I need help`` with estrogen.
I don't mean to medicalize this experience —
only ``to claim it``,
and put it ``in my body.``

I operate best on hormones I don't produce.
``Most women`` call that menopause.
I call it transition.

---------

|These fragments| are my own,
not a guide to trans experience.
Some will ``relate to parts.``
Others won't.

  <label for="erasure">These fragments</label>


---------

There's a temptation to cherry-pick the past,
to ``emphasize one`` particular story-arc,
associate myself with the proper stereotypes,
and prove I was *born this way* — 
a ``girl`` from my first breath.

``In`` the final years before my ``transition,``
I was begging the pieces to fit perfectly.
I wanted a narrative that could prove my gender,
once and ``for all.
That story doesn't exist.``

---------

``A friend asks`` me what it means ``to be a woman``.
I have no idea.
What does it mean for you ``to be your`` gender?

---------

Dysphoria is a subtle,
grumpy, ``subconscious beast —``
like an upset stomach,
``or the anger you feel`` when you haven't eaten.

Gender dysphoria is *hangry*.

There's no instruction manual,
``or arrow`` pointing *you are here*.
Your hunger
doesn't take the time
to stop and explain itself
before ``driving you mad.``

---------

``I watch`` Eddie Izzard,
and think maybe I'm an *action transvestite*,
but the lazy kind with a beer gut,
who has no time for makeup,
and finds ``dresses`` unflattering.

Megan asks if I've been a good boy ``this year.``
*I'm not very good at being a boy,
if that's what you mean.*
She says ``I'm genderqueer,``
so I attend the
Trans and Genderqueer Poetry Symposium.

Rose asks *what pronouns do people use for you*?
That's ``not the question`` she meant to ask,
and not the question I wish I was answering.
Neither of us correct our mistake.

Erin asks me point-blank,
but I don't know the answer.
For a week,
``she uses`` all the pronouns interchangeably,
but I only like the moments of *she/her/hers*.

``It's hard`` getting anyone else to follow suit.
I think maybe ``changing my name``
will help,
but it doesn't much.

I tell N— how I'm feeling.
*That's because you're not on hormones yet*.
I believe her,
``but there's a`` waiting ``list.``

---------

``I never`` felt like a girl. 
What do girls feel like?
I didn't *always know*,
and ``dream`` of wearing dresses.
I wasn't consistent, insistent, or persistent.

I was *frustrated*.

Even after I pinned that pain
``on gender,``
it took years to make sense of the fragments.

---------

Sometimes you don't know the pain is real
``until it goes away.``

---------

I first `call myself trans`_
while speaking to 60-some relatives at a family reunion.
Sometimes I do things the hard way.
``Everyone is`` supportive,
but no one notices their pronouns,
and it feels like nothing will ever ``change.``

Grandma asks if ``I'm planning`` to transition medically,
and I say no.
I'm wrong.

.. _call myself trans: /2016/08/17/trans

---------

Cis women warn me about
the ``emotional terrors`` of estrogen.
*Clearly you haven't tried testosterone*,
I say.
*That shit'll fuck you up*.

---------

Transition is a ``wild waffling``
between dysphoria and euphoria.
The ``changes`` all seem minor,
but the results are ``life-changing.``
I'm the same person,
completely,
and ``not at all.``

---------

I lose two shoe sizes,
and twenty-two pounds.
``I can't lift`` my bass amp,
and rarely get turned on —
but when I do it's electric.
The world is several degrees colder,
to make up for ``global warming, I suppose.``
Emotions live in my body, taking root.
``I'm all`` nerve endings,
raw and ``exposed to the elements.``
When I pay attention,
``I love`` every second of it.

---------

He ``genders`` me right,
in that ``condescending`` tone reserved for women.
I'm excited ``and horrified.``

---------

Many people become frustrated by the trappings of gender — 
the rules and regulations imposed by our culture.
``We are not`` the only people
to push against these limits.
Then the ``boys`` find their inner princess,
``and girls`` grow up to be president (please),
``and everyone else`` moves on.

As my brother says,
*cis does not mean simple*.

I wanted that story too — 
a complex gender,
``breaking from tradition``
without crossing any lines.
I hoped gender was only ``a construct,``
and a change in performance could destroy my dysphoria.
I wanted to express my feminine traits and move on.

But *feminine* is not my gender.
Painted nails are not what it means to be a woman.
Gender is often performed,
but the performance ``is not the whole story.``
The play is not the thing.

---------

A visiting trans friend asks where I get my T.

*I make it inside my body*,
I tell him.
*I'd give it to you if I could*.

---------

My doctor doesn't require
a therapist's approval,
but she tells me
*it's helpful if you have one*.
I don't know what that means.
My therapist writes a letter,
just in case.

``I have to`` sign a form
that explains the effects of hormone therapy.
They bring me the wrong form:
*Consent for Masculinizing Hormone Therapy*.
I ``ask for the`` other form, please.
Probably a clerical error,
but it feels good.

This is called *informed consent*.
Expect ``breast growth,``
changes in body fat,
``and thinning`` body hair.
Don't expect ``changes`` in voice
or facial hair.
The form is full of typos,
but I sign it anyway.
Later that day,
I take my first hormone pills.

---------

``Everyone asks me`` if I'll keep dating women.
*The better question*,
I say,
*will women keep dating me*?
I wonder ``which part`` of transition
should change who I find attractive.
The name and pronoun,
or hormones,
``or a possible surgery`` down the road?
This all ``sounds absurd.``
I was bi before,
I'm bi now,
and I expect to be bi for a very long time.

Some do find that transition
allows them more comfort
in dating or noticing
different genders than before.
``Sometimes sexuality is just`` about
feeling comfortable and paying attention.
Nothing is ``set in stone.``

---------

I'm still `learning to identify`_ as a woman,
and as a lesbian.
``Both are`` over-simplifications.
Maybe a non-binary ``genderqueer trans woman``
bi/pansexual femme tomboy dyke?

I was assigned male,
and learned to identify as a man — 
no matter how odd or painful that felt.
My identity was male ``for 33 years.``
Even when the label means nothing to you,
it can be hard to shake off.

.. _learning to identify: /2016/12/24/clarifications

---------

- My gender identity is frustrated?
- My gender frustration is female?

---------

``I'm terrified`` that all I want is
the mythical teenage sleepover,
and ``I'm too late`` for that.
The Internet is all tweens and early teens,
afraid they are too old for hormones.
I read all the wrong things,
and cry for weeks.

---------

I told myself I was ``too masculine`` to transition.

I told myself I looked too young without a beard.
I told myself a beard would allow me to be more queer.
I used my beard as a beard,
in the way gay boys and lesbians team up
``to throw you off the scent.``
I told myself
*if you don't try you can't fail*.
If I have a beard,
no one will think I'm trans.
I was right.
``My own fear and`` self-hatred
became my strongest defense.
I told myself *it's only a body*.
I told myself nothing fit right.

---------

A ``friend jokes`` about the useless buttons
on the ``back of my new coat.``
*Those buttons aren't useless*,
I tell him.
*That's how people know I'm a woman*.

---------

I believed ``gender was only`` a performance
when my own ``gender was a`` performance.
Others believe ``gender`` aligns with genitals,
because theirs does.
It's hard to look ``beyond`` your own experience.
That's why we have `empathy`_.

I realized I was ``trans``
when rejecting ``gender`` only made things worse.

.. _empathy: https://medium.com/@juliaserano/empathy-politics-d7f62aa90e75#.6p8z24z5w

---------

I've been fortunate
``to have the partners I have.``
None of us knew
if our relationships would survive this transition,
but both are queer as ``fuck,``
and I don't know how I would have survived
``without them.``

Thank you Rachel.
Thank you Erin.
``You mean the world`` to me.

---------

I'm not trans because of the things I like,
or the people I sleep with.
I'm not trans in order to paint my nails,
fuck boys, join a coven,
or get a free drink on Ladies Night.
I'm not ``exploring my feminine side,``
or enjoying the realities of sexism,
``objectification,`` double-standards, mansplaining, and harassment.
I could do ``all those things`` before.

I'm trans because ``the doctors called`` me a man
and they were ``wrong.``

---------

I thought I was borrowing a scraper,
``but then`` he just cleaned off the car for me.
This doesn't happen when you look like a boy person.

---------

The bank ask to see my marriage license.
When ``I don't have one,``
they ask the reason for my name change?
I make a list of possible reasons:

- Just in case.
- ``That time of the week.``
- I lost my old name, on the bus to Boulder.
- Identity theft.

---------

There's a ``period`` where
I can't use *he/him/his* for anyone.
I pause before every pronoun,
confused.

---------

``I don't know`` how many trans people I know.
After transition, many fade from view.
Cis-assumption helps us blend in,
for our own safety.
Others haven't come out yet.

Visibility is dangerous,
but without it we're ``monsters`` under the bed.

---------

"Passing" is not ``something I do,``
but something that happens to me —
not a way of presenting,
but a way of being seen.
*Fickle*.
In a single moment
I ``can be seen and not seen,``
gendered and misgendered.
Ungendered, and undressed.

I start using the women's restroom
when others start seeing a woman —
not 100%,
but ``enough to feel`` un/safe.

Suddenly ``the men's room`` feels impossible.
I'm terrified,
but I'm waiting for the FF2 from Boulder,
and can't hold it any longer.
It's been a year now,
``without incident.``

---------

When I say *gender change*,
people only hear *genitals*.

---------

``We talk about`` socialization,
as though ``kids
only ever`` hear the half story
intentionally directed their way.
As though we're not all taught
``to hate women`` equally.
As though I can't see past the mistake
when I'm assigned male,
``and build`` my own ``feminine shame``
outside your view.
As though I could survive 33 years
without learning to cower.

---------

A friend asks if ``I like to dress femme``
in the bedroom,
or roleplay with crossed genders.
I don't think ``my pain is that sexy.``

---------

``I tell my mom`` on the phone,
*I think I'm more binary than I think*.
She's confused.
So am I.
I think I need to transition.

I watch `a video of Kate Bornstein`_,
and think
*finally, yes*.
``Nothing she says``,
just her existence is enough.
N— says
*Women can be anything.
Transition first, then explore*.

.. _a video of Kate Bornstein: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-bornstein-queer-icon-reflects-on-queer-and-trans-identity-in-2015_561823aae4b0e66ad4c7ff37

---------

Trying on clothes ``to see if they fit``
is way better than trying on clothes ``to see if your gender fits.``
I didn't know there was a difference,
until everything changed.

``I can finally hate`` my body for the normal reasons.

---------

*Transgender* and *Transsexual* always existed somewhere else,
in another world.
``Extreme terms.``
I felt an affinity
for cross-dressers, drag queens, and trans women alike
(I wouldn't distinguish until later), 
``but the connection`` was fragile.
They ``seemed so fierce`` and fabulous —
wisp-thin and perfect-femme —
nothing ``like a thick Indiana`` farm-boy.

On screen, their stories always ended badly.

----------

Robert spent the ``night,``
but Audrey wasn't allowed to.
Later,
the boys tell me not to play with her
on the playground,
``and I listen.``

----------

A stranger asks me if I'm
*like, full tranny*.
``That's not a thing.``

---------

``Living as`` a boy,
pink became a symbol of something
I could never fully articulate.
Pink was ``a personal rebellion —``
pain played-off as politics.

But pink ``is only subversive`` for men.
In the end,
my rebellion reinforced my misgendering.
A month into transition,
I cleared all the pink from my closet.

---------

Hormones are ``slow magic.``

---------

If you are wondering,
*am I trans*,
the answer is almost certainly
*yes love,
and you are beautiful*.
``No two stories are`` the same,
but what we have in common
is that pain,
and that wondering.
You aren't ``stuck forever.``
You have options.

---------

- In my dreams, ``I'm transgender.``
- In the mirror, ``I'm uncertain.``
- In public, ``I'm a woman.``

Being trans isn't about knowing
anything clearly,
or ``even seeing it`` when others do.
I transitioned on faith —
my intuition ``jumping out ahead of`` my identity.
I'm still surprised when I look in ``the mirror,``
but I look as often as I can —
for ``the euphoria of`` that surprise,
or just to normalize it over ``time.``

---------

— *Ma'am, that account says 'Eric Meyer'* |br|
— *That's my old… boyfriend? Can I change it?*

---------

``I took`` a few voice lessons,
for a better sense of ``control over my presentation.``
``I don't worry about`` a particular pitch,
or gender-socialized speech patterns —
just dropping some of that bass chest resonance.
It was something small I could do
before the hormones kicked in.

---------

`This was never a male body`_,
it was always ``a trans body.``

My body was trans as a kid. |br|
My body is trans now. |br|
My body will always be trans.

.. _This was never a male body: http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/07/19/there_s_no_such_thing_as_a_male_body.html

---------

Recently, I had a nightmare about swimming.
First I was worried about the swimsuit I don't have.
``Will I try some on?``
Then I saw the locker room doors,
and woke up in a panic.

---------

I change my last name to Suzanne
to avoid identity confusion in my career.
I pick Suzanne from a list of family names
my parents kindly send over.
``I'm half-aware`` at the time
``that`` I should be changing my given name instead.
I move unspecified "M" to the middle,
with a sense that I might need it later.

Given different genital circumstances,
``I would have been`` Miriam Suzanne Meyer at birth,
or Mary Sue,
or ``another variant``.
After three years,
I change my first name to Miriam,
and move Eric to the middle —
for ``a sense of gender-queering history``
that I can drop to an initial at any time.

The man ``at TSA`` looks confused.
*Is that supposed to say Erica?*

---------

``My first night out with`` a new name,
I stumble and hate every minute.
``Erin`` holds my hand and
introduces me to friends.
*This is my girlfriend*.
I'm trying to be dainty,
maybe, or demure.
``It's disgusting,
and I want to vomit.``

``Hanson is`` on the radio.
Why is Hanson on the radio?

I know that
woman is not an action,
but a description —
what I am, not what I do.
``Knowing in my mind
and knowing in my body``
are different things.
Eventually ``I'm able to relax``
and be myself.
It's ``a new feeling.``

---------

An ex said
she won't be happy
until I'm *dead, gay, or castrated*.
I'm ``going for the hat`` trick.

---------

After years of ``looking queer,``
it's strange to realize
you're suddenly no-longer noteworthy —
just one more woman walking down the street.
It happened ``while I`` wasn't paying attention:
the queer kids stopped giving me that knowing nod.

Whatever ``made me stand out`` before,
now only blends me in.

---------

A few months ``on hormones,``
and flying becomes ``surreal.``
The woman checking ID says
*I guess you'll want to get that changed*
as she hands back my license.
``Another woman beckons me`` through the scanner,
and presses the pink button as I enter —
then pulls me aside
``when the machine highlights
my`` gender-failing ``crotch.``

— *I'm sorry ma'am, you triggered an alarm.
I mean, excuse me,
we don't say alarm now,
we say anomaly.* |br|
— *Yeah. I'm trans.* |br|
— *I know, ma'am.
Is it ok if I pat you down?*

I buy PreCheck to avoid the scanners.
Later I learn that a good tuck —
or ``six more months`` blocking testosterone —
is enough to pass their gender test.
Press ``that pink button`` all you want.
I guess this is what it means to be a woman?

---------

In Colorado,
your chosen name `has to sue`_ your given name
``for the right to exist.``

.. _has to sue: /2017/01/19/america-heard

---------

Transition is not a binary.
We all exist on a spectrum,
stretching out in many dimensions.
My transition will never be complete,
and my gender will never be simple or static.
*Woman* is only one label among many.
None are perfect on their own,
but ``we all live at intersections.
We all contain multitudes.``

``I don't believe`` in authenticity,
but I do believe ``in pain,``
and doing something ``to survive it.``
