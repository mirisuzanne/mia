America Heard: Transitions
**************************

My friend `Maureen Maloney`_ asked to document
my reaction to the 2016 election,
as part of the `America Heard`_ film series:

    Our goal is to feature at least one film
    from each of the 435 congressional districts
    and show the diversity of political perspectives
    throughout the United States.

    --`America Heard`_

Working with Dana Forsberg and Katie Cook,
we put together this short documentary â€”
talking about trans rights,
and completing one step of my legal name change.
Thanks to `Teacup Gorilla`_ and Erin Rollman
for joining in the fun!
