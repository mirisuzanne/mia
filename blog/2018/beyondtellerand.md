  I love when conferences give me
  the opportunity to travel around the world.
  I love it even more when conferences
  go beyond the web
  to find inspiration from other fields.

# Beyond Tellerand

Right from the start,
Beyond Tellerand was unlike other conferences.
Rather than hearing familiar talks
about familiar technology,
the first day took us on a journey through
web annotations, intricate illustrations,
design for non-designers,
robots with personality,
stop-motion tinkering,
and programatically-generated art.

I spoke on day two,
followed by "bleeding edge" accessibility,
large-scale projection-mapping,
the women who built the internet,
and a lesson on ethics in tech.
How could I even begin to match
the inspirational scope of these other presenters,
while talking about layout?
