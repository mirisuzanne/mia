  I love when conferences give me
  the opportunity to travel around the world.
  I love it even more when conferences
  go beyond the web
  to find inspiration from other fields.

Right from the start,
Beyond Tellerand was unlike other conferences.
Rather than hearing familiar talks
about familiar technology,
the first day took us on a journey through
web annotations, intricate illustrations,
design for non-designers,
robots with personality,
stop-motion tinkering,
and programatically-generated art.

I spoke on day two,
followed by "bleeding edge" accessibility,
large-scale projection-mapping,
the women who built the internet,
and a lesson on ethics in tech.
How could I even begin to match
the inspirational scope of these other presenters,
while talking about layout?
