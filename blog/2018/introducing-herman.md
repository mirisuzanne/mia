tagline: 'An agile approach to design systems on a budget'
summary: |
  **Design systems streamline development, communication, and consistency** --
  but often rely on dedicated teams and extended budgets.
  We wanted a tool to create and maintain
  living style guides & pattern libraries
  in an agile process, and on a budget.

# Herman Style Guides

I'm always curious how many attendees at a conference
are working on enterprise projects
over a long period of time
vs. those of us who do consulting
for multiple clients each year.
These different contexts can lead to very different solutions --
affecting team size, budget, process, architecture,
and technical requirements.
