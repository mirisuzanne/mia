Dan |&| Sondra are the other 2/3 of [Teacup Gorilla][tg],
and have been a great help with the novel.
Sondra has been helping me edit the images,
while Dan is writing the music.
In the meantime,
they have moved downtown
and started a very exciting art/business venture
that will be announced very soon.
I can't wait!

I began this portrait in the same manner
as the Kitten Karlyle illustration,
and quickly found that it was the wrong style for these two.
I made several more stylistic attempts,
and was unhappy with all of them.
We call that "the creative process".
I finally found the style I wanted
by accidentally viewing all my sketches
layered on top of each other.
The rest was just a matter of cleanup.
