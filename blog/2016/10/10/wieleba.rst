    <p>
      I look in the mirror
      and see a person looking back at me every day,
      a person I didn’t necessarily think I’d ever see.
      I like that person.
      I genuinely like that person.
      I like the way she holds herself.
      I like the confidence you can see
      behind her muted green eyes.
      She has seen me at my worst
      and she has seen me at my best.
      She is a person that makes me happy
      and I am so thrilled I get to spend
      the rest of my life with her.
      I wish everyone could look into that mirror.

Estrogentrification: Jordan Wieleba

Jordan and I were never close.
Her colleagues say she was private,
but I only experienced her generosisty,
kindness, and humor.
She is one of the first trans women I talked to
before coming out.
She was blunt about her own experience,
but endlessly supportive.
*You do you, girl. You have to do you.*
After that, she checked in regularly —
making sure I was ok.

I know I wasn't the only trans woman she helped.
Jordan saved lives.

I only saw her perform once,
and it was amazing.
She's also a great `writer`_.
I recommend a trip down her `rabbit hole`_.
Is that gross?
It sounds gross.
