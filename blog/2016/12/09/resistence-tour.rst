summary: |
  It's been a month
  since our country pseudo-elected
  a bigoted blow-hard for president.
  I'm heading to DC to protest his inauguration in January,
  visit friends,
  and go on a mixed-media resistance tour...


Some Kind of Resistance Tour, 2017
==================================

On tour, I'll be:

- reading from my queer-as-fuck novel `Riding SideSaddle*`_,
  while being a loud and vocal trans woman.
- speaking about empathy
  in art and code and software.
- chatting about queer identities,
  hate, politics, and intersectionality.
- hugging people.

I'm not changing the world here,
`there's more to do`_,
but it feels like a nice way to get started,
find my energy,
and find my people.
