summary: |
  `Exit Strata`_ asked me to design the cover of their next issue,
  `PRINT!`_ VOL 3.

    ...focussed on issues of translation, transmutation,
    and language forms across media,
    as well as the textual/visual/sonic/physical (etc) manifestations
    of these transmissions as they travel between and betwixt our minds...
    The biggest tension is between that of the printed page
    and that of the new virtual realities...

  There's only one way I know to make all that happen.

Stratified Design
=================

|8|

`Layer tennis`_ is a design game
made popular by `Coudal Partners`_.
Two competitors
(myself & `Aaron Liechty`_)
pass design files back and forth,
riffing on the same work under extreme time constraints.
Each 30-minute "volley" is posted live as it is created,
along with commentary (`Jacob Liechty`_).

`Sondra Eisenstat`_ agreed to
help us with
the thankless task of posting it all online,
since the rest of us were pre-occupied with
writing & designing under pressure.

The battle took place on Sunday afternoon.
The full experience is still available
on the `Exit Strata blog`_,
but here are the volleys:
