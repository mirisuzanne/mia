Chalk Outline
-------------

When I started writing `this blog series`_ in November,
I was in a hurry to post articles right away —
ignoring everything I know about good process.
I posted a few `pressing`_ `thoughts`_,
and then tried to write my way through the `5-step process`_
from `one end`_ to the other.

It didn't work,
and each post is now taking me longer and longer to write,
with more frustration than the last.
I've written this post 4 times now,
each time on different topics.

Starting from `an outline`_ can be comforting,
but it's not possible to organize material you don't yet have,
and you end up pushing yourself off in the wrong direction.
That's where I went wrong.

Play it Again
-------------

I skipped a step,
and now I have to go back and do it right.

It's time to gather all my material and see what I have,
generate more ideas,
scrap the failures,
and rearrange what's left into articles.
This may take some time,
but once that is done
I should be able keep up a regular posting schedule.

Recycle
-------

Lucky for me,
none of my failed posts are wasted effort.
They all work towards the goal I should have started with:
collecting material.
I have a recycling bin for every project —
a file or folder to catch all the scraps as I work.
Now I have a substantial start on what I need:
my very own "Fuck the Muse" `shitty pile of shit`_.
