Poetry Readings are Terrible
============================

Dear Poets,

You don't publish without editing,
why do you perform without rehearsing?
The stage is a different medium.
Have you considered working with a voice coach?

Words don't speak for themselves: they require punctuation.

Sincerely, |br|
