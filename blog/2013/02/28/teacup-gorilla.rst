Teacup Gorilla + Bouldering Poets
=================================

|five5|

`Teacup Gorilla`_ formed in 2010
to create the live soundscape for `Missa Populi`_,
an original performance by `Vicious Trap`_.
From there we were asked to play a steampunk wedding,
which turned into a year-long collaboration
with `Rachel Eisenstat`_,
followed by a `novel soundtrack`_,
and a new `recording studio & venue`_
in the Denver downtown.

Over three years,
we've only performed as Teacup Gorilla
a handful of times,
but we've been quite active.
And now we're making our way back to the original performance vision,
starting at the `Bouldering Poets`_ series:

  March 22, 7:30pm at `303 Vodka`_ |
  see `facebook`_ for details.

We're back,
and we have big plans.
