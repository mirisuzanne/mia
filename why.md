  People are `queer`.
  People are edge cases.
  We fall between meanings,

That, to me, is beautiful.
All of us stumbling
through this wreckage `and rubble together`,
finding beauty in the world
and in each other along the way.
Software that respects our opinions and autonomy;
collaborations that reflect back our diversity;
and art that gives us a venue to consider
<label for="erasure">the non-sense</label>
that remains —
what manifestos can never say.
Because understanding is not a pre-requisite `for beauty`.

So I like narratives that are full of
holes and misdirection.
Bits borrowed from here and there,
fragments and remixes,
fused into a visceral barrage,
inviting you into an experience —
the start of `a conversation`.
Diverse people breathing and sweating
and fighting and playing together.
Accidents, contradictions, and broken expectations.
Grasping at stability and form,
but always `coming up short`.
