<h1>CSSDay 2016 Recap</h1>
<p><code>CSS Day 2016</code> covered a wide range of topics for a one day conference
including SVG, animation, color theory, design, layout and more. Throughout the
day, a focus on code architecture was a theme. Attendees heard a few different
perspectives which were interesting to listen to and compare.</p>
<p>Below are the available videos and slides of each session, including two from
our very own OddBirds.</p>
