<h1>Django, Background Processes, and Keeping Users in the Loop</h1>
<p>In my last post, I talked about how a modern web app needs background worker
processes. One way or another, you’ll have some things you need to do that are
slower than you can do in a request/response cycle, and so you’ll want to
handle them out of band. Have the API return a simple <code>202 ACCEPTED</code> and move
on with your life, right?</p>
