**The Obsolete Book in a Post-Obsolete World,
as Represented by a Post-Obsolete Book About Dance**

A [performable website][post-obsolete]
in the spirit (and tutelage)
of [Michelle Ellsworth][michelle] --
with text-to-speech voice-over,
transparencies,
party hats,
diagrams,
whiskey,
handouts,
and music by [The Widow's Bane][[Widow's Bane].

Mortimer Leech was gracious about my use of their music:

> Follow your bliss, Mia.
> Take no prisoners.
> We're already dead.
> What the fuck do we want with money?

Thank you Mr. Leech.

The piece
requires a few props:

- overhead projector
- party hats
- noise makers
- an old book about dance
- 10-page printed handouts
- tweed jacket
- whiskey
