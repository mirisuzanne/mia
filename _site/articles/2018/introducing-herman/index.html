<p>I’m always curious how many attendees at a conference
are working on enterprise projects
over a long period of time
vs. those of us who do consulting
for multiple clients each year.
These different contexts can lead to very different solutions –
affecting team size, budget, process, architecture,
and technical requirements.</p>
