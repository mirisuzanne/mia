<h1>VueConf US</h1>
<p>I enjoyed the conference as much as I enjoy the framework.
I was particularly impressed with the way core team members
talk about community and future development.
Everyone was welcoming,
interested in my contributions,
and helpful when I had questions.
Several of the core team members are now helping us
build Vue component documentation into Herman,
our style guide generator.</p>
