<p>A <a href="http://www.post-obsolete.com">performable website</a>
in the spirit (and tutelage)
of <a href="http://michelleellsworth.com/">Michelle Ellsworth</a> –

transparencies,
party hats,
diagrams,
whiskey,
handouts,
and music by [The Widow’s Bane][<a href="http://www.myspace.com/widowsbane">Widow’s Bane</a>.</p>
<p>Mortimer Leech was gracious about my use of their music:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow your bliss, Mia.
Take no prisoners.
We’re already dead.
What the fuck do we want with money?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you Mr. Leech.</p>

<li>10-page printed handouts</li>
