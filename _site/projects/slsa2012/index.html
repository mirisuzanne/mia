I’ll be in Milwaukee this weekend
for a brief appearance at the
SLSA 2012 jurried elit event –
performing the Post-Obsolete Book.</p>

<p>I’ll be in <code>Milwaukee</code>_ this weekend
for a brief appearance at
<code>SLSA 2012</code><em>.
The <code>ELO</code></em> is hosting a jurried elit event,
and accepted my <code>submission</code>_:</p>
<p>We found the piece to be fun and entertaining,
but it also contains an argument that is worth considering
(and not just from a technical perspective).
The idea of objective forms dying and becoming immortal
is an interesting way to think about obsolete forms.
Against the backdrop of the death of the book,
the question of how to write seems as alive and well as it ever has.
This piece highlights that in a clever way.</p>
<p>Thank you, ELO/SLSA jury.</p>
<h1>The Obsolete Book in a Post-Obsolete World</h1>
<p>My text is <code>available online</code><em>,
but the performance includes text-to-speech voice-over,
<code>Michelle Ellsworth</code></em> dancing,
transparencies,
party hats,
diagrams,
whiskey,
powerpoint handouts,
music by <code>The Widow's Bane</code>_,
one human,
and one post-obsolete book.</p>
<p>Mortimer Leech of Widow’s Bane
was gracious about my theft:</p>
<p>Follow your bliss, Mia.
Take no prisoners.
We’re already dead.
What the fuck do we want with money?</p>
<p>Thank you Mr. Leech.</p>
<h1>Electronic Literature &amp; the Nonhuman</h1>
<p>Saturday, September 29th, 5-7pm |
201C of the Frontier Airlines Center |
Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts 2012 Conference</p>
<p>I’ll be performing along with <code>Mark Marino</code>_
(who is a fantastic human)
and many others I can’t wait to meet.
Maybe they’re humans too! Who can say?</p>

<p>After submitting on a whim,
I was <code>invited to perform</code>_
last weekend at the SLSA_
conference in Milwaukee,
and I went.
This was not a reasonable thing to do.</p>

<h1>Friday</h1>
<p>It was a whirlwind_ of a weekend.
The piece,
|obsolete|,
requires a long list of props,
but all I took along was a shopping list:</p>
<ul>
<li>overhead projector</li>
<li>party hats</li>
<li>noise makers</li>
<li>an old book about dance</li>
<li>10-page printed handouts</li>
<li>tweed jacket</li>
<li>whiskey</li>
</ul>
<p>I flew in on Friday night,
drank a bottle of sake,
and commandeered my friend, Micah,
as a driver for the next day.</p>

    <em>
      The Obsolete Book in a Post-Obsolete World,
      as Represented by a Post-Obsolete Book About Dance</em></a>
<h1>Saturday</h1>
<p>Overhead projectors are not easy to find,
but Micah tracked one down
at a party-supply rental shop on the other side of town.
When we arrived, they had to dust it off and test the bulb.
Lucky for us, it worked.</p>
<p>And our luck lasted the entire day.
Apart from a few problems with printers and staplers,
we found everything with time to spare.</p>

      (1) Two trips to FedEx & two shitty staplers, but we have handouts.
      (2) Party supplies & a cute boy behind the counter at Walgreen's.
      (3) Goodwill has tweed & an old book for me,
          and three gilded soccer trophies for Micah.
      (4) A bread knife helps make this old western more anonymous.
      (5) Just enough to whiskey for a 10-minute piece.
      (6) "Mad GAY" graffiti conversation above the urinal (unrelated).

<p>We had to sneak into the conference,
because neither of us had registered,
carried our gear upstairs to
Frontier Airlines Center 201C,
I performed for ten minutes,
and flew out again the next day.</p>
<p>The other performances included
Jeremy Douglass,
Katherine Hayles,
Patrick Jagoda,
Patrick LeMieux,
Clarissa Lee,
Amy Letter,
M.D. Coverley,
Mark Marino,
Nick Montfort,
and Stuart Moulthrop.
A great group!</p>

You can’t see things very well,
but you can <code>follow along on the website</code></em>

It will be just like you were there
with handout in hand!</p>
