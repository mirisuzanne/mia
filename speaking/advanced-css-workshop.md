From building beautiful sites
to maintaining complex design systems across applications,
CSS is the web-language of design.
Like all web languages,
**Cascading Style Sheets have come a long way
since their early inception** --
providing powerful and dynamic tools
for cross-browser and cross-device interface design.

Miriam will introduce a variety of new and advanced CSS techniques,
along with practical use-cases, integrations, and pitfalls.
You’ll learn how to manage CSS variables, grids, calculations,
support queries, and more --
but understanding the syntax is only a start.
We’ll talk about building a robust code architecture
with CSS-driven design systems,
passing data between JS and CSS,
and combining modern techniques to solve real,
everyday interface problems.

In this workshop, you’ll learn:

- Modern CSS Features:
  custom properties (variables), calc, grids, flexbox, writing modes,
  advanced media & support queries, and more
- Building powerful interactions between CSS and JS
- Combining techniques to solve practical problems,
  from layout and theming to interaction and data visualization
- Common gotchas and work-arounds
- Using Sass to write more meaningful and maintainable systems
- CSS & Sass architecture patterns that scale
- Writing Sass & CSS for design systems & pattern-library automation

The workshop is intended for professional front-end developers
with experience in HTML and CSS.
