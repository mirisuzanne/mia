**Susy isn't a grid-system like most others**,
providing out-of-the box layouts.
Instead, we've abstracted grid-calculations
to build a meta-grid system --
allowing you to create the perfect grids for your project,
without us getting in the way.
You can use Susy with floats,
flexbox, tables, or any other CSS technique.
You’re the expert, we’re just here to make your job easier.
