**Style Guides & Pattern Libraries are great tools**
for documenting the relationships between code and design,
but beautiful docs are only half the battle.
We don’t all have dedicated teams and budgets
to build a centralized system.
How can we build patterns into our code,
using templates and pre-processors to iterate and automate
living design systems in an agile and integrated process?

- Using templates and pre-processors for pattern-making in CSS and HTML.
- Designing and integrating toolkits that force pattern-making.
- Examples of what weve done, where weve failed, and where were headed.
