So much so that I’d like to <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/2022/06/12/indiewebifying-a-wordpress-site-2022-edition/\">link you up to a new post David wrote after we talked</a>, then summarize things here as best as I can because (1) it’s helpful to write things down and (2) have a reference for later.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h3>Yes, IndieWeb is confusing.</h3>\n<p>David had actually helped someone get their WordPress site all set up with IndieWeb powers. That person, too, was struggling to understand how the various pieces fit together. So, David already had this top of mind when Miriam and I were writing.</p>\n<p>“IndieWeb” is a new term for many folks and that’s where a lot of confusion breeds. Is it a framework? A philosophy? A set of standards? Depending on which one it is, the expectations shift as far as what it looks like to be a part of it.</p>\n<p>It’s sort of all of the above. And that needs to be solidified a bit. There’s nothing inherently confusing about IndieWeb itself once you view it through those different lenses. After reading David’s post my understanding is that IndieWeb is more of a set of protocols. Sorta like working with structured data or OpenGraph in markup. There’s nothing to install per se, but there are standards for how to integrate them into your work.</p>\n<p>Your identity powers IndieWeb. In other words, your site establishes your identity and can be used to do lots of things, like:</p>\n<ul><li>Notify other IndieWeb-supported sites when they are mentioned</li>\n<li>Receive notifications from other IndieWeb sites when you are mentioned</li>\n<li>Fetch information from a mention and format it for display</li>\n<li>Authenticate your identity through your own website (a là a Google sign-in button but connected to your site)</li>\n<li>…among other things.</li>\n</ul><p>If that sorta sounds like pingbacks, well, it sorta is. But much more robust and maintained.</p>\n<h3>It’s different (and perhaps easier) to implement IndieWeb features on WordPress than it is a static site.</h3>\n<p>The big difference is that WordPress provides a lot of the requirements needed to do IndieWeb-y things. I like how David explains it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The IndieWeb implementation on WordPress is a [series] of building blocks that you can or cannot choose to use, which is what makes it wonderful, but sometimes confusing. WordPress has a philosophy of decisions, not options. But the IndieWeb is all about options…about building the features that are right for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those building blocks are plugins that you install to add IndieWeb protocols and technologies to WordPress. It’s awesome those are readily available because that takes a a lot of the work out of things. Running a static site, though, you’re on the hook for establishing most of that yourself.</p>\n<p>David’s post is 100% focused on the WordPress implementation. Your mileage may vary, but you will certainly walk away with a better idea of what protocols are available and how they fit together after reading his post — and hopefully this one as well.</p>\n<h3>The IndieWeb WordPress plugin establishes your identity.</h3>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=1024,332&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"De-Mystifying IndieWeb on a WordPress Site\" /><p>I thought it was doing so much stuff behind the scenes, but it’s a lot more simple than that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The plugin by itself handles establishing your identity as the IndieWeb sees it. It offers an h-card template and widget. H-Card is the markup for marking up information about a person or place. So, this is an element many people opt to put on their site anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, really, it’s possible to get the same sort of thing by correctly marking up a WordPress theme. The convenience here is that you get a handy little template that’s marked up to support the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card\"><code>h-card</code> open format</a> and a widget to drop it into a theme’s widget area.</p>\n<p>Here’s a super detailed example of the <code>h-card</code> markup pulled from the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card#Example\">documentation for Microformats2</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"h-card\"&gt;\n  &lt;img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"photo of Mitchell\"\n       src=\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"/&gt;\n  &lt;a class=\"p-name u-url\"\n     href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\" \n    &gt;Mitchell Baker&lt;/a&gt;\n (&lt;a class=\"u-url\" \n     href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n    &gt;@MitchellBaker&lt;/a&gt;)\n  &lt;span class=\"p-org\"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"p-note\"&gt;\n    Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"p-category\"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"p-category\"&gt;Leadership&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>See those class names? Classes like <code>.h-card</code>, <code>u-photo</code>, <code>p-name</code>, etc. all provide contextual meaning for a person’s identity which it then parsed as JSON:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"items\": [{ \n    \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"photo\": [\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"],\n      \"name\": [\"Mitchell Baker\"],\n      \"url\": [\n        \"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\",\n        \"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n      ],\n      \"org\": [\"Mozilla Foundation\"],\n      \"note\": [\"Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\"],\n      \"category\": [\n        \"Strategy\",\n        \"Leadership\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The plugin isn’t doing the sending, receiving, or parsing. Instead, it provides a WordPress site with a way to verify your identity in the markup.</p>\n<h3>Not all WordPress themes support Microformats</h3>\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=1544,500&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p>If you scratched your head first time you saw “Microformats” like I did, David defines it nicely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[…] Microformats…a way of marking up HTML to allow elements to be identified. It is one of several ways of doing this, but is a very simple and readable one, which is why it is popular in the IndieWeb community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem, as David continues, is that many themes aren’t marked up in a Microformats-friendly way — which is what the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-uf2/\">Microformats2 plugin</a> is designed to fix.  That said, David is quick to call out that the plugin is extremely limited in how it accomplishes this, and he recommends instead marking up a theme by hand.</p>\n<p>According to David, the next major release of the Webmention plugin will likely include smarter ways of detecting content and images it can use and formatting them for Microformats2 support.</p>\n<h2>Webmentions send and receive notifications.</h2>\n<img width=\"772\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.jpg?resize=772,250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p>OK, so if you’ve established your identity through your site so you are discoverable, and your site is marked up for <code>h-card</code> support using Microformats2. Great! You still need something in the middle working as an operator that sends and receives notifications. In other words, when another site mentions you — called a Webmention — the site mentioning you needs a way to support sending that mention to you, and your site needs a way to accept it (or vice versa).</p>\n<p>That’s what the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\">Webmention plugin</a> is for. It’s also probably the source of most of my IndieWeb confusion. I thought it was formatting data and needed an additional service to send and receive it. Nope! It’s actually sending and receiving the data rather than creating the mention. Back to David:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Back when it was built, the plugin handled only the business of receiving and sending webmentions, not handling display to any degree. Semantic Linkbacks, a separate plugin handled that for not only webmentions, but the older pingback and trackback protocols.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Webmention plugin is communicating notifications. Meanwhile, another plugin called Semantic Linkbacks is what handles the data. And what the heck are Semantic Linkbacks?</p>\n<h2>Semantic Linkbacks fetch and handle data.</h2>\n<img width=\"772\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.png?resize=772,250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/\">Semantic Linkbacks</a> is another plugin that handles another piece of the process. There’s no way I can explain it better than David already does:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Semantic Linkbacks takes a webmention, which is a notification that another site has linked to something on your site, fetches the other site, and tries to render a display of the information. How that is done can vary from just a profile photo (if it can find one), to interpreting it as a full comment.</p>\n<p>It does this using Microformats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I expected that the main IndieWeb plugin was already doing this since it handles other markup. But it only provides the template and widget to get your identity on your site. Once the Semantic Linkbacks plugin fetches an incoming webmention, it takes the data, formats it, then attempts to display it.</p>\n<p>Sounds like the plugin will be somewhat merged with (or replaced by) an upcoming version of the Webmention plugin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since many people are not inclined, or not comfortable modifying a theme, the new version of Webmentions will include several different alternative ways to try to find an image or summary to display…from OpenGraph (which Facebook and Twitter use to display URLs provided to it) to detecting the WordPress REST API version of a page and using that to get the author name and profile image. None of them will provided as much context as Microformats, but the experience will still be something worth installing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s certainly nice as it taps into the WordPress REST API for the JSON response and formats that for display.</p>\n<h3>Brid.gy is a service to help display interactions.</h3>\n<p>A Webmention can be an interaction, say someone likes your post on Twitter or retweets it.</p>\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?resize=1690,998&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p>Differentiating a like from a repost from a comment from a whatever needs to happen, and you’d need to implement the Twitter (or whatever) API to draw those distinctions.</p>\n<p>That’s something you can certainly do!

Vanishingly little Webmention spam has been seen in the wild. <br /><br />\nRemoving the pingback link from the header of that particular page (or others that might get linked to with heavily trafficked sites like CSS-Tricks which are often pirated) should solve your immediate problem. Hopefully those who are working on additional anti-spam features will add to these measures to further mitigate this sort of issue for the broader publics' use and adoption. I've personally experienced this sort of \"attack\" at least once in the pingback space and another using the even older refbacks specification. On my small personal site, I leave them all on however, particularly for the small slice of academic blogging community that still uses pingbacks and the benefits generally outstrip the annoyance. Naturally your mileage may vary and you may consider turning them off.<br /><br />\nOf course, you'll probably also realize that the reason the CSS-Tricks notification was caught in spam was because it also came in as a pingback and not by webmetion. (I'm pretty sure that they don't have webmention set up to send them, so their site would have only sent a pingback.)  <br /><br />\nMany of the older systems, including WordPress which are frequently used by these same sorts of pirates, will still send/trigger pingbacks. Within the IndieWeb space, most sites explicitly sending webmention notifications will include h-cards with author names and timestamps which is part of why Max Böck’s filtering solution works well.<br /><br />\nOn the positive side, I wonder if this sort of notification behavior might help sites like CSS-Tricks to track these sort of bad actors for help in potential take downs of this sort of piracy?",

        "html": "<h2>Some history of this blog</h2><p>When I start blogging, I was using a blog engine called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>\nbut I wasn’t ok with the way it was designed. I wanted to be able to write my posts in a way that was easy to read and edit. I want to have a lightweight blog engine so I change to <a href=\"https://blog.getpelican.com/\">Pelican</a>\nand I use for sometime. Sometime later, not happy with the tags and categories, I decided to switch to <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>\nand I’m happier with it.</p><p>But I feet some time I wasn’t happy with Hugo so I search something else.\nAfter some time I find an article about <a href=\"https://victoria.dev/blog/make-your-own-independent-website/\">Independent website</a>\nand the tecnology for make a independent website.</p><p>In this article I discover:</p><ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/buckket/twtxt\"><em>Twtxt</em></a>\na protocol for instances for a decentralized timeline experience</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://fundor333.com/post/2022/indieweb-webmention-and-h-entry-in-my-blog/Webmention\"><em>Webmention</em></a>\nand an <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io\">easy implementation</a>\nfor it</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\"><em>IndieWeb</em></a>\nfor POSSE, an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</li>\n</ul><p>So I decided to study them for adding in my blog.</p><h2>Twtxt</h2><p>First tecnology I read about and I found it strange.</p><p>It call himself <em>decentralises, minimalist microblogging service for hackers</em> but it is only a txt file in your domain. Something like this:</p><pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span><span>2016-02-04T13:30:00+01:00   You can really go crazy here! ┐(ﾟ∀ﾟ)┌\n</span></span><span><span>2016-02-03T23:05:00+01:00   @&lt;example &lt;http://example.org/twtxt.txt&gt;&gt; welcome to twtxt!\n</span></span><span><span>2016-02-01T11:00:00+01:00   This is just another example.\n</span></span><span><span>2015-12-12T12:00:00+01:00   Fiat lux!\n</span></span></code></pre><p>You can “tweet” from your domain to the world… It is a good idea but I don’t like it.</p><p>I was using it for a time but I prefer to use <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@fundor333\">mastodon</a>\nor webmention.</p><p>Also it isn’t compatible with my stack for the blog (my github pages builder aren’t compatible with twtxt without rewrite all my stack) and I don’t like the way it is implemented: it is a good idea to have a decentralized timeline but I prefere something easy to use anda update with a mobile phone or a tablet unlike twtxt.</p><p>So I decided to study the others tecnologies.</p><h2>Webmention</h2><p>My favorite tecnology of the article.</p><blockquote>\n<p>Webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site.

        "text": "Some history of this blogWhen I start blogging, I was using a blog engine called WordPress\nbut I wasn’t ok with the way it was designed. I wanted to be able to write my posts in a way that was easy to read and edit. I want to have a lightweight blog engine so I change to Pelican\nand I use for sometime. Sometime later, not happy with the tags and categories, I decided to switch to Hugo\nand I’m happier with it.But I feet some time I wasn’t happy with Hugo so I search something else.\nAfter some time I find an article about Independent website\nand the tecnology for make a independent website.In this article I discover:\nTwtxt\na protocol for instances for a decentralized timeline experience\n\nWebmention\nand an easy implementation\nfor it\n\nIndieWeb\nfor POSSE, an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere\nSo I decided to study them for adding in my blog.TwtxtFirst tecnology I read about and I found it strange.It call himself decentralises, minimalist microblogging service for hackers but it is only a txt file in your domain. Something like this:2016-02-04T13:30:00+01:00   You can really go crazy here! ┐(ﾟ∀ﾟ)┌\n2016-02-03T23:05:00+01:00   @<example <http://example.org/twtxt.txt>> welcome to twtxt!\n2016-02-01T11:00:00+01:00   This is just another example.\n2015-12-12T12:00:00+01:00   Fiat lux!\nYou can “tweet” from your domain to the world… It is a good idea but I don’t like it.I was using it for a time but I prefer to use mastodon\nor webmention.Also it isn’t compatible with my stack for the blog (my github pages builder aren’t compatible with twtxt without rewrite all my stack) and I don’t like the way it is implemented: it is a good idea to have a decentralized timeline but I prefere something easy to use anda update with a mobile phone or a tablet unlike twtxt.So I decided to study the others tecnologies.WebmentionMy favorite tecnology of the article.\nWebmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site. From the receiver’s perspective, it’s a way to request notifications when other sites mention it.\nWebmention w3c specification\nThis is a wonderfull way to interact between two websites. You can use it to send a notification to a third party when you mention it on your site or to send a notification to your site when you mention it on a third party site.You can use to check also interaction with your twitter, mastodon, reddit and github with some tools like Bridgy\n.ImplementationThanks to Jamie’s post\n,Jamie’s post\nand Paul’s post\nI implemented my own display section for the webmentions.I wrote and rewrote the code for the display section but now it’s something simple:for getting the webmentions from Webmention.io\nI use the js package PlaidWeb/webmention.js\nwith some changes for the rendering.theme/layouts/partials/webmentions.html<script src=\"/webmention.min.js\" data-wordcount=\"100\" async=\"\" data-add-urls=\"https://fundor333.com{{ .RelPermalink}}\">\n</script>\n\n<div id=\"webmentions\" class=\"row\">\n</div>\nI suggest to download and edit the webmention.min.js\nfile for adding some customizations for the rendering and add some CSS because the basic theme is minimal.With this code imported, you can show the webmention feed on your site in real time.IndiwebRealy the big thing and the last thing I studied and implement.\nIt is “a people-focused alternative to the corporate web” and it has three core concepts:Your content is yours\nYou are better connected\nYou are in control\nI \nit.So I rewrote all my templates to implement the Indiweb concept:Find a domain for my space\nAdding an h-card/microformat\nto my homepage\nAdding an h-card/microformat\nto my posts’ articles\nAdding the social media profiles for implementing the IndieAuth identity\n\nAdding RSS feeds and/or other type of feeds\nAfter one or two month of work on my template the work was done and I was happy.\nAnd I search for more posts about indiweb and webmentions because I WANT MORE, so I find a lot of articles, posts and tweet about this stack of tecnologies.One of my favorite posts about indiweb is AM I ON THE INDIEWEB YET? by Miriam Suzanne\n.Here are some more articles I find about webmentions:Adding Webmention Support to a Static Site\nAdding Webmentions to My Static Hugo Site\nAdding Webmentions to my blog\nAdding Webmentions to My Static Hugo Site\nMicroblogging\nIf you liked this article,please share it on or webmention it"
