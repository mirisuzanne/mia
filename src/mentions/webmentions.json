According to my browser history, I visited \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org\" title=\"IndieWeb.org\">IndieWeb.org</a>\n on June 15, 2022, so around a month ago. I read up on <strong>Miriam Suzanne</strong>’s hugely popular post \n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\" title=\"Am I on the IndieWeb Yet?\">Am I on the IndieWeb Yet?</a>\n and searched Google for “hugo indieweb” in the hopes there was some kind of \n<a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/micro/2021/05/indieweb-recipe\" title=\"recipe\">recipe</a>\n to get me started on my static page (I’m a developer and after all *<em>let’s say it all together</em>* developers are lazy).</p>\n<p>There wasn’t THE ONE answer I was hoping for, but instead lot’s and lot’s of blog posts by people describing their way of getting into the IndieWeb. I was overwhelmed and intrigued at the same time, so I let it rest for a couple of days - four, to be exact. The afternoon of June 20, 2022, I went deep, even deeper than \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjcA2xSH25Y\" title=\"Jamiroquai\">Jamiroquai</a>\n, into the rabbit hole that is <strong>The IndieWeb</strong>. Let’s retrace my steps through said browser history and commits.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/07/indiewebify-me-and-dont-forget-my-webmentions/#whats-indieweb\">\n      Link</a>What’s IndieWeb?\n</h2><blockquote>\n<p>The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. - \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org\" title=\"IndieWeb.org\">IndieWeb.org</a>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s what it says on the cover. It’s about owning your content, sharing your thoughts and ideas in one place and then syndicating it to other (social) platforms. What if Twitter, for example, will be bought by a stupidly rich philanthropist who decides to shut it down? Where will all your tweets go?</p>\n<p>In my opinion, your Twitter or your Facebook profile should not be your digital identity, owned by a tech company. You should be the sole owner of the content you share online. And that’s what IndieWeb encourages people to do.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/07/indiewebify-me-and-dont-forget-my-webmentions/#how-does-it-work\">\n      Link</a>How does it work?\n</h2><p>Alright, from here on, I’ll be outlining which steps I took, to make my website ready for the IndieWeb.</p>\n<p>I already owned a domain and space to host a site, so that’s a given, though I wasn’t aware of it being an actual requirement to “become a citizen of the IndieWeb”. I first stumbled upon <strong>Amit Gawande</strong>’s post \n<a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/02/10/204300.html\" title=\"IndieWebify Your Hugo Website\">IndieWebify Your Hugo Website</a>\n, because this site is also generated using Hugo. I actually \n<a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/02/chringel-hugo-theme/\" title=\"wrote the theme myself\">wrote the theme myself</a>\n, so making changes to it’s markup wouldn’t be a problem.</p>\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/07/indiewebify-me-and-dont-forget-my-webmentions/#1-set-up-web-sign-in\">\n      Link</a>1. Set up Web Sign In\n</h3><p>In order to authenticate yourself as the owner of your website using your domain, you will need to set up means to sign in via \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth\" title=\"IndieAuth\">IndieAuth</a>\n.

Add Webmentions\n</h3><p>After I read <strong>Fundor 333</strong>’s post \n<a href=\"https://fundor333.com/post/2022/indieweb-webmention-and-h-entry-in-my-blog/\" title=\"How I implement Indieweb, Webmention and H Entry in My Blog\">How I implement Indieweb, Webmention and H Entry in My Blog</a>\n I was wondering: <em>What are Webmentions?</em></p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\" title=\"Webmentions\">Webmentions</a>\n are a W3C recommendation for conversations and interactions across websites. It’s a simple way to notify an URL when it is mentioned i.e. by me or on my site. It is basically a way of interacting with other people’s content from your website.</p>\n<p><strong>For example</strong>: I read a super interesting post on another blog and I want to reply to it, or show my appreciation by reacting to it. I can do that, by writing a post on my site, referencing that other post and add markup indicating this is a response or a like. I can then send a Webmention to that other blog, telling it I reacted to it from my website.</p>\n<p>Sounds complicated? Well, it’s just like Twitter, where you react to a tweet by commenting or liking it.</p>\n<p>I found out there’s an easy way to set up Webmentions: \n<a href=\"https://webmention.io/\" title=\"Webmention.io\">Webmention.io</a>\n, written and maintained by \n<a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\" title=\"Aaron Parecki\">Aaron Parecki</a>\n. It’s a service that handles Webmentions, simply by using Web Sign-In and adding some endpoints as links to your website.</p>\n<p>This would work perfectly as kind of a plug-and-play solution for my theme for others to use. But I’m more the guy who likes to self-host stuff. The \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention#Publisher_Services\" title=\"list of publisher services on indieweb.org\">list of publisher services on indieweb.org</a>\n has some alternatives for sending and receiving Webmentions. I settled with \n<a href=\"https://github.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming\" title=\"Go-Jamming\">Go-Jamming</a>\n by <strong>Wouter Groeneveld</strong>. It’s a really well written replacement for Webmention.io. Also his post \n<a href=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/05/beyond-webmention-io/\" title=\"Host your own webmention receiver\">Host your own webmention receiver</a>\n was most helpful.</p>\n<p>After Go-Jamming was running on my server, I \n<a href=\"https://github.com/chringel21/chringel-hugo-theme/commit/2221490cb96e86640ad2c83da9489ca391e07094\" title=\"added the Webmention endpoints\">added the Webmention endpoints</a>\n.</p>\n<pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code>&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"webmention\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"https://jam.chringel.dev/webmention\"</span> /&gt;\n&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"pingback\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"https://jam.chringel.dev/pingback\"</span> /&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Now all that was missing was a way to display them.

        "text": "I actually can’t recall anymore, what got me started with this whole IndieWeb thing. According to my browser history, I visited \nIndieWeb.org\n on June 15, 2022, so around a month ago. I read up on Miriam Suzanne’s hugely popular post \nAm I on the IndieWeb Yet?\n and searched Google for “hugo indieweb” in the hopes there was some kind of \nrecipe\n to get me started on my static page (I’m a developer and after all *let’s say it all together* developers are lazy).\nThere wasn’t THE ONE answer I was hoping for, but instead lot’s and lot’s of blog posts by people describing their way of getting into the IndieWeb. I was overwhelmed and intrigued at the same time, so I let it rest for a couple of days - four, to be exact. The afternoon of June 20, 2022, I went deep, even deeper than \nJamiroquai\n, into the rabbit hole that is The IndieWeb. Let’s retrace my steps through said browser history and commits.\n\n  \n      LinkWhat’s IndieWeb?\n\nThe IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. - \nIndieWeb.org\n\n\nThat’s what it says on the cover. It’s about owning your content, sharing your thoughts and ideas in one place and then syndicating it to other (social) platforms. What if Twitter, for example, will be bought by a stupidly rich philanthropist who decides to shut it down? Where will all your tweets go?\nIn my opinion, your Twitter or your Facebook profile should not be your digital identity, owned by a tech company. You should be the sole owner of the content you share online. And that’s what IndieWeb encourages people to do.\n\n  \n      LinkHow does it work?\nAlright, from here on, I’ll be outlining which steps I took, to make my website ready for the IndieWeb.\nI already owned a domain and space to host a site, so that’s a given, though I wasn’t aware of it being an actual requirement to “become a citizen of the IndieWeb”. I first stumbled upon Amit Gawande’s post \nIndieWebify Your Hugo Website\n, because this site is also generated using Hugo. I actually \nwrote the theme myself\n, so making changes to it’s markup wouldn’t be a problem.\n\n  \n      Link1. Set up Web Sign In\nIn order to authenticate yourself as the owner of your website using your domain, you will need to set up means to sign in via \nIndieAuth\n. That means you use your domain to verify yourself as the owner of your other social profiles.\nJust add a rel=me \nmicroformat\n to all your links leading to your profiles on other platforms. That’s actually the first thing I changed and made a \ncommit\n for.\nHint: All code excerpts are reduced to a minimal working example.\n<div>\n  {{ range .Site.Menus.social }}\n  <a rel=\"me\" href=\"{{ .URL }}\" title=\"{{ .Name }}\"> {{ .Name }} </a>\n  {{ end }}\n</div>\nNext, \nI added an authorization endpoint\n to validate my identity. There are different services, but \nIndieAuth.com\n seems to be the go to solution.\n\n{{ with .Site.Params.indieweb }}\n  <link\n    rel=\"authorization_endpoint\"\n    href=\"{{ .authorizationEndpoint | default \"https://indieauth.com/auth\" }}\"\n  />\n  <link\n    rel=\"token_endpoint\"\n    href=\"{{ .tokenEndpoint | default \"https://tokens.indieauth.com/token\" }}\"\n  />\n{{ end }}\nI also read about it on Ana Ulin’s post \nUsing Your Site As Your Login\n. I went back to her \nposts about IndieWeb\n a couple of times during my journey.\n\n  \n      Link2. Add author markup\nNext step was to actually provide some basic information about myself, on my website. Sure, I already had an \nAbout page\n, but that’s not machine readable. The h-card \nmicroformat\n provides properties that can be parsed. \nHere’s the commit\n.\n\n<div class=\"h-card\">\n  <p>\n    <a class=\"u-url\" href=\"{{ .Site.BaseURL }}\">{{ .Site.Title }}</a>\n    {{ with .Site.Params.Hcard.Avatar }}\n      <img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"\" src=\"{{ . | absURL }}\" />\n    {{ end }}\n    <span class=\"p-name\" rel=\"me\">\n      {{ .Site.Params.Hcard.FullName }}\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  {{ with .Site.Params.Hcard.Biography }}\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"p-note\">{{ . | markdownify }}</span>\n    </p>\n  {{ end }}\n</div>\nAgain, this is a minimal example. There are many more properties that can be added. This is where I found \nIndieWebify.me\n, a nice guide to check whether your site is ready for the IndieWeb.\n\n  \n      \n        Valid h-card entry parsed by IndieWebify.me\n      \n    \n  \n      Link3. Add content markup\nIf you want to publish content on the IndieWeb, it has to be machine readable as well. I added more markup, this time to my post templates. That’s the h-entry \nmicroformat\n. IndieWebify.me was a huge helper for this step. A \ncouple\n \nof\n \ncommits\n and \niterations\n later, my content was recognized correctly.\nIn this example, I add the following h-entry properties:\n\np-name - the post’s title\n\ne-content - the post’s content\n\np-author - who wrote the post\n\ndt-published - when the post was published\n\nu-url - the permalink to the post\n\np-category - categories or tags for the post\n{{ define \"main\" }}\n  <article class=\"h-entry\">\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">{{ .Title }}</h1>\n    <p class=\"e-content\">{{ .Content }}</p>\n    <div>\n      <span>Posted By:</span>\n      <a rel=\"author\" class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"{{ \"about\" | relURL }}\">\n        {{ .Params.author }}\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pb-2\">\n      <span>Posted:</span>\n      <time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .PublishDate.Format \"January 2, 2006\" }}\">\n        <a class=\"u-url\" href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ $publishDate }}</a>\n      </time>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pb-2\">\n      <span>Categories:</span>\n      {{ range $idx, $category := . }}\n        {{- if ne $idx 0 }}{{ end }}\n        <a class=\"p-category\" href=\"{{ \"categories/\" | relURL }}{{ $category | urlize }}\">\n          {{ $category }}\n        </a>\n      {{- end }}\n    </div>\n  </article>\n{{ end }}\n\n  \n      \n        Valid h-card parsed by IndieWebify.me\n      \n    At this point, my content is correctly marked up to be consumed by the IndieWeb. This was all relatively easy. The next step was a little bit more challenging, because it meant working on the backend.\n\n  \n      Link4. Add Webmentions\nAfter I read Fundor 333’s post \nHow I implement Indieweb, Webmention and H Entry in My Blog\n I was wondering: What are Webmentions?\n\nWebmentions\n are a W3C recommendation for conversations and interactions across websites. It’s a simple way to notify an URL when it is mentioned i.e. by me or on my site. It is basically a way of interacting with other people’s content from your website.\nFor example: I read a super interesting post on another blog and I want to reply to it, or show my appreciation by reacting to it. I can do that, by writing a post on my site, referencing that other post and add markup indicating this is a response or a like. I can then send a Webmention to that other blog, telling it I reacted to it from my website.\nSounds complicated? Well, it’s just like Twitter, where you react to a tweet by commenting or liking it.\nI found out there’s an easy way to set up Webmentions: \nWebmention.io\n, written and maintained by \nAaron Parecki\n. It’s a service that handles Webmentions, simply by using Web Sign-In and adding some endpoints as links to your website.\nThis would work perfectly as kind of a plug-and-play solution for my theme for others to use. But I’m more the guy who likes to self-host stuff. The \nlist of publisher services on indieweb.org\n has some alternatives for sending and receiving Webmentions. I settled with \nGo-Jamming\n by Wouter Groeneveld. It’s a really well written replacement for Webmention.io. Also his post \nHost your own webmention receiver\n was most helpful.\nAfter Go-Jamming was running on my server, I \nadded the Webmention endpoints\n.\n<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://jam.chringel.dev/webmention\" />\n<link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"https://jam.chringel.dev/pingback\" />\nNow all that was missing was a way to display them. I read through several blog posts how to render Webmentions in a static site: Jessica Smith’s post \nHow I Integrated Webmentions Into My Hugo Static Site\n, Keith Grant’s post \nAdding Webmention Support to a Static Site\n and of course Wouter Groeneveld’s post that I already mentioned.\n\nTwo\n \ncommits\n later I had markup for displaying responses (as in comments) and reactions (as in favorites, reposts…).\nMy current (semi-automatic) workflow for parsing Webmentions goes like this:\n(Watch the feed for incoming Webmentions at https://jam.chringel.dev/feed/)\nWhen my site is built with Github Actions, fire up a simple node.js script to fetch Webmentions as JSON from the API\nHugo processes the JSON file while building my site\n\n  \n      Link5. Syndication and Backfeed\nOne last peace to the puzzle were two terms I came across while reading all those posts that seemed to belong together: \nPOSSE\n and \nbackfeed\n.\nThe first means publishing your content on your own site first, and then post links on other (social) platforms (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), for example tweeting about your post with a link to your site.\nThe latter describes the process of pulling in interactions of your POSSE copies to the original post. So, if someone comments on a tweet with the link to your post, it actually gets reverse syndicated to your site as a Webmention.\n\nAdding syndication markup\n is easy, it’s just another \nmicroformat\n.\n\n{{ with .Params.syndication }}\n  {{ range $silo, $url := . }}\n    <a href=\"{{ $url }}\" class=\"u-syndication\" rel=\"syndication\">{{ title $silo }}</a>\n  {{ end }}\n{{ end }}\nAnd add the links where you syndicated your post in the front matter.\n\n---\n...\nsyndication:\n  mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/web/@chringel/...\n  twitter: https://twitter.com/DeEgge/status/...\n...\n---\nTo achieve backfeed, I use a service called \nbrid.gy\n. Once you are authenticated “Bridgy polls your silo posts, discovers original post links, and sends comments to those links as webmentions” (\nHow to use\n). It automatically scrapes your site and checks links in your tweets or toots if they have a Webmention endpoint to notify them, when they are mentioned. It works quite well for what I want to achieve, which is displaying reactions to my posts from other platforms on my website.\n\n  \n      LinkNext steps\nWhat I’m currently missing is a way of having IndieWeb conversations (IndieWeb level 3, according to IndieWebify.me).

        "html": "<p>Well, sheesh. I opened a little can of worms when sharing Miriam’s <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">“Am I on the IndieWeb yet?”</a> with a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/am-i-on-the-indieweb-yet/\">short post bemoaning my own trouble</a> getting on the IndieWeb train. But it’s a good can of worms.</p>\n<p>I think it was something like the next day after publishing that short post that <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/\">David Shanske</a> reached out and offered to help wrap my head around IndieWeb and the components that it comprises. And gosh dang if it wasn’t ridiculously helpful! So much so that I’d like to <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/2022/06/12/indiewebifying-a-wordpress-site-2022-edition/\">link you up to a new post David wrote after we talked</a>, then summarize things here as best as I can because (1) it’s helpful to write things down and (2) have a reference for later.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h3>Yes, IndieWeb is confusing.</h3>\n<p>David had actually helped someone get their WordPress site all set up with IndieWeb powers. That person, too, was struggling to understand how the various pieces fit together. So, David already had this top of mind when Miriam and I were writing.</p>\n<p>“IndieWeb” is a new term for many folks and that’s where a lot of confusion breeds. Is it a framework? A philosophy? A set of standards? Depending on which one it is, the expectations shift as far as what it looks like to be a part of it.</p>\n<p>It’s sort of all of the above. And that needs to be solidified a bit. There’s nothing inherently confusing about IndieWeb itself once you view it through those different lenses. After reading David’s post my understanding is that IndieWeb is more of a set of protocols. Sorta like working with structured data or OpenGraph in markup. There’s nothing to install per se, but there are standards for how to integrate them into your work.</p>\n<p>Your identity powers IndieWeb. In other words, your site establishes your identity and can be used to do lots of things, like:</p>\n<ul><li>Notify other IndieWeb-supported sites when they are mentioned</li>\n<li>Receive notifications from other IndieWeb sites when you are mentioned</li>\n<li>Fetch information from a mention and format it for display</li>\n<li>Authenticate your identity through your own website (a là a Google sign-in button but connected to your site)</li>\n<li>…among other things.</li>\n</ul><p>If that sorta sounds like pingbacks, well, it sorta is. But much more robust and maintained.</p>\n<h3>It’s different (and perhaps easier) to implement IndieWeb features on WordPress than it is a static site.</h3>\n<p>The big difference is that WordPress provides a lot of the requirements needed to do IndieWeb-y things. I like how David explains it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The IndieWeb implementation on WordPress is a [series] of building blocks that you can or cannot choose to use, which is what makes it wonderful, but sometimes confusing. WordPress has a philosophy of decisions, not options. But the IndieWeb is all about options…about building the features that are right for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those building blocks are plugins that you install to add IndieWeb protocols and technologies to WordPress. It’s awesome those are readily available because that takes a a lot of the work out of things. Running a static site, though, you’re on the hook for establishing most of that yourself.</p>\n<p>David’s post is 100% focused on the WordPress implementation. Your mileage may vary, but you will certainly walk away with a better idea of what protocols are available and how they fit together after reading his post — and hopefully this one as well.</p>\n<h3>The IndieWeb WordPress plugin establishes your identity.</h3>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=1024,332&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"De-Mystifying IndieWeb on a WordPress Site\" /><p>I thought it was doing so much stuff behind the scenes, but it’s a lot more simple than that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The plugin by itself handles establishing your identity as the IndieWeb sees it. It offers an h-card template and widget. H-Card is the markup for marking up information about a person or place. So, this is an element many people opt to put on their site anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, really, it’s possible to get the same sort of thing by correctly marking up a WordPress theme. The convenience here is that you get a handy little template that’s marked up to support the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card\"><code>h-card</code> open format</a> and a widget to drop it into a theme’s widget area.</p>\n<p>Here’s a super detailed example of the <code>h-card</code> markup pulled from the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card#Example\">documentation for Microformats2</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"h-card\"&gt;\n  &lt;img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"photo of Mitchell\"\n       src=\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"/&gt;\n  &lt;a class=\"p-name u-url\"\n     href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\" \n    &gt;Mitchell Baker&lt;/a&gt;\n (&lt;a class=\"u-url\" \n     href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n    &gt;@MitchellBaker&lt;/a&gt;)\n  &lt;span class=\"p-org\"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"p-note\"&gt;\n    Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"p-category\"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"p-category\"&gt;Leadership&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>See those class names? Classes like <code>.h-card</code>, <code>u-photo</code>, <code>p-name</code>, etc. all provide contextual meaning for a person’s identity which it then parsed as JSON:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"items\": [{ \n    \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"photo\": [\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"],\n      \"name\": [\"Mitchell Baker\"],\n      \"url\": [\n        \"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\",\n        \"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n      ],\n      \"org\": [\"Mozilla Foundation\"],\n      \"note\": [\"Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\"],\n      \"category\": [\n        \"Strategy\",\n        \"Leadership\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The plugin isn’t doing the sending, receiving, or parsing. Instead, it provides a WordPress site with a way to verify your identity in the markup.</p>\n<h3>Not all WordPress themes support Microformats</h3>\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=1544,500&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p>If you scratched your head first time you saw “Microformats” like I did, David defines it nicely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[…] Microformats…a way of marking up HTML to allow elements to be identified. It is one of several ways of doing this, but is a very simple and readable one, which is why it is popular in the IndieWeb community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem, as David continues, is that many themes aren’t marked up in a Microformats-friendly way — which is what the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-uf2/\">Microformats2 plugin</a> is designed to fix.  That said, David is quick to call out that the plugin is extremely limited in how it accomplishes this, and he recommends instead marking up a theme by hand.</p>\n<p>According to David, the next major release of the Webmention plugin will likely include smarter ways of detecting content and images it can use and formatting them for Microformats2 support.</p>\n<h2>Webmentions send and receive notifications.</h2>\n<img width=\"772\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.jpg?resize=772,250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p>OK, so if you’ve established your identity through your site so you are discoverable, and your site is marked up for <code>h-card</code> support using Microformats2. Great! You still need something in the middle working as an operator that sends and receives notifications. In other words, when another site mentions you — called a Webmention — the site mentioning you needs a way to support sending that mention to you, and your site needs a way to accept it (or vice versa).</p>\n<p>That’s what the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\">Webmention plugin</a> is for. It’s also probably the source of most of my IndieWeb confusion. I thought it was formatting data and needed an additional service to send and receive it. Nope! It’s actually sending and receiving the data rather than creating the mention. Back to David:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Back when it was built, the plugin handled only the business of receiving and sending webmentions, not handling display to any degree. Semantic Linkbacks, a separate plugin handled that for not only webmentions, but the older pingback and trackback protocols.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Webmention plugin is communicating notifications. Meanwhile, another plugin called Semantic Linkbacks is what handles the data. And what the heck are Semantic Linkbacks?</p>\n<h2>Semantic Linkbacks fetch and handle data.</h2>\n<img width=\"772\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.png?resize=772,250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/\">Semantic Linkbacks</a> is another plugin that handles another piece of the process. There’s no way I can explain it better than David already does:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Semantic Linkbacks takes a webmention, which is a notification that another site has linked to something on your site, fetches the other site, and tries to render a display of the information. How that is done can vary from just a profile photo (if it can find one), to interpreting it as a full comment.</p>\n<p>It does this using Microformats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I expected that the main IndieWeb plugin was already doing this since it handles other markup. But it only provides the template and widget to get your identity on your site. Once the Semantic Linkbacks plugin fetches an incoming webmention, it takes the data, formats it, then attempts to display it.</p>\n<p>Sounds like the plugin will be somewhat merged with (or replaced by) an upcoming version of the Webmention plugin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since many people are not inclined, or not comfortable modifying a theme, the new version of Webmentions will include several different alternative ways to try to find an image or summary to display…from OpenGraph (which Facebook and Twitter use to display URLs provided to it) to detecting the WordPress REST API version of a page and using that to get the author name and profile image.

        "text": "Well, sheesh. I opened a little can of worms when sharing Miriam’s “Am I on the IndieWeb yet?” with a short post bemoaning my own trouble getting on the IndieWeb train. But it’s a good can of worms.\nI think it was something like the next day after publishing that short post that David Shanske reached out and offered to help wrap my head around IndieWeb and the components that it comprises. And gosh dang if it wasn’t ridiculously helpful! So much so that I’d like to link you up to a new post David wrote after we talked, then summarize things here as best as I can because (1) it’s helpful to write things down and (2) have a reference for later.\n\nYes, IndieWeb is confusing.\nDavid had actually helped someone get their WordPress site all set up with IndieWeb powers. That person, too, was struggling to understand how the various pieces fit together. So, David already had this top of mind when Miriam and I were writing.\n“IndieWeb” is a new term for many folks and that’s where a lot of confusion breeds. Is it a framework? A philosophy? A set of standards? Depending on which one it is, the expectations shift as far as what it looks like to be a part of it.\nIt’s sort of all of the above. And that needs to be solidified a bit. There’s nothing inherently confusing about IndieWeb itself once you view it through those different lenses. After reading David’s post my understanding is that IndieWeb is more of a set of protocols. Sorta like working with structured data or OpenGraph in markup. There’s nothing to install per se, but there are standards for how to integrate them into your work.\nYour identity powers IndieWeb. In other words, your site establishes your identity and can be used to do lots of things, like:\nNotify other IndieWeb-supported sites when they are mentioned\nReceive notifications from other IndieWeb sites when you are mentioned\nFetch information from a mention and format it for display\nAuthenticate your identity through your own website (a là a Google sign-in button but connected to your site)\n…among other things.\nIf that sorta sounds like pingbacks, well, it sorta is. But much more robust and maintained.\nIt’s different (and perhaps easier) to implement IndieWeb features on WordPress than it is a static site.\nThe big difference is that WordPress provides a lot of the requirements needed to do IndieWeb-y things. I like how David explains it:\n\nThe IndieWeb implementation on WordPress is a [series] of building blocks that you can or cannot choose to use, which is what makes it wonderful, but sometimes confusing. WordPress has a philosophy of decisions, not options. But the IndieWeb is all about options…about building the features that are right for you.\n\nThose building blocks are plugins that you install to add IndieWeb protocols and technologies to WordPress. It’s awesome those are readily available because that takes a a lot of the work out of things. Running a static site, though, you’re on the hook for establishing most of that yourself.\nDavid’s post is 100% focused on the WordPress implementation. Your mileage may vary, but you will certainly walk away with a better idea of what protocols are available and how they fit together after reading his post — and hopefully this one as well.\nThe IndieWeb WordPress plugin establishes your identity.\nI thought it was doing so much stuff behind the scenes, but it’s a lot more simple than that:\n\nThe plugin by itself handles establishing your identity as the IndieWeb sees it. It offers an h-card template and widget. H-Card is the markup for marking up information about a person or place. So, this is an element many people opt to put on their site anyway.\n\nSo, really, it’s possible to get the same sort of thing by correctly marking up a WordPress theme. The convenience here is that you get a handy little template that’s marked up to support the h-card open format and a widget to drop it into a theme’s widget area.\nHere’s a super detailed example of the h-card markup pulled from the documentation for Microformats2:\n<div class=\"h-card\">\n  <img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"photo of Mitchell\"\n       src=\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"/>\n  <a class=\"p-name u-url\"\n     href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\" \n    >Mitchell Baker</a>\n (<a class=\"u-url\" \n     href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n    >@MitchellBaker</a>)\n  <span class=\"p-org\">Mozilla Foundation</span>\n  <p class=\"p-note\">\n    Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\n  </p>\n  <span class=\"p-category\">Strategy</span>\n  <span class=\"p-category\">Leadership</span>\n</div>\nSee those class names? Classes like .h-card, u-photo, p-name, etc. all provide contextual meaning for a person’s identity which it then parsed as JSON:\n{\n  \"items\": [{ \n    \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"photo\": [\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"],\n      \"name\": [\"Mitchell Baker\"],\n      \"url\": [\n        \"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\",\n        \"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n      ],\n      \"org\": [\"Mozilla Foundation\"],\n      \"note\": [\"Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\"],\n      \"category\": [\n        \"Strategy\",\n        \"Leadership\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}\nThe plugin isn’t doing the sending, receiving, or parsing. Instead, it provides a WordPress site with a way to verify your identity in the markup.\nNot all WordPress themes support Microformats\nIf you scratched your head first time you saw “Microformats” like I did, David defines it nicely:\n\n[…] Microformats…a way of marking up HTML to allow elements to be identified. It is one of several ways of doing this, but is a very simple and readable one, which is why it is popular in the IndieWeb community.\n\nThe problem, as David continues, is that many themes aren’t marked up in a Microformats-friendly way — which is what the Microformats2 plugin is designed to fix.  That said, David is quick to call out that the plugin is extremely limited in how it accomplishes this, and he recommends instead marking up a theme by hand.\nAccording to David, the next major release of the Webmention plugin will likely include smarter ways of detecting content and images it can use and formatting them for Microformats2 support.\nWebmentions send and receive notifications.\nOK, so if you’ve established your identity through your site so you are discoverable, and your site is marked up for h-card support using Microformats2. Great! You still need something in the middle working as an operator that sends and receives notifications. In other words, when another site mentions you — called a Webmention — the site mentioning you needs a way to support sending that mention to you, and your site needs a way to accept it (or vice versa).\nThat’s what the Webmention plugin is for. It’s also probably the source of most of my IndieWeb confusion. I thought it was formatting data and needed an additional service to send and receive it. Nope! It’s actually sending and receiving the data rather than creating the mention. Back to David:\n\nBack when it was built, the plugin handled only the business of receiving and sending webmentions, not handling display to any degree. Semantic Linkbacks, a separate plugin handled that for not only webmentions, but the older pingback and trackback protocols.\n\nSo, the Webmention plugin is communicating notifications. Meanwhile, another plugin called Semantic Linkbacks is what handles the data. And what the heck are Semantic Linkbacks?\nSemantic Linkbacks fetch and handle data.\nSemantic Linkbacks is another plugin that handles another piece of the process. There’s no way I can explain it better than David already does:\n\nSemantic Linkbacks takes a webmention, which is a notification that another site has linked to something on your site, fetches the other site, and tries to render a display of the information. How that is done can vary from just a profile photo (if it can find one), to interpreting it as a full comment.\nIt does this using Microformats.\n\nI expected that the main IndieWeb plugin was already doing this since it handles other markup. But it only provides the template and widget to get your identity on your site. Once the Semantic Linkbacks plugin fetches an incoming webmention, it takes the data, formats it, then attempts to display it.\nSounds like the plugin will be somewhat merged with (or replaced by) an upcoming version of the Webmention plugin:\n\nSince many people are not inclined, or not comfortable modifying a theme, the new version of Webmentions will include several different alternative ways to try to find an image or summary to display…from OpenGraph (which Facebook and Twitter use to display URLs provided to it) to detecting the WordPress REST API version of a page and using that to get the author name and profile image. None of them will provided as much context as Microformats, but the experience will still be something worth installing.\n\nThat’s certainly nice as it taps into the WordPress REST API for the JSON response and formats that for display.\nBrid.gy is a service to help display interactions.\nA Webmention can be an interaction, say someone likes your post on Twitter or retweets it.\nDifferentiating a like from a repost from a comment from a whatever needs to happen, and you’d need to implement the Twitter (or whatever) API to draw those distinctions.\nThat’s something you can certainly do! But if you’d rather plug and play, one of the IndieWeb community members made a service called Brid.gy. You create an account, hook up your site, and give app permissions to the service… then you’re done!\nWhat Brid.gy has done is essentially implement the APIs for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, so that when it detects that a post in those services that interacts with your syndicated post, a Webmention is sent to your site and goes through the process of publishing on your own site.\nThere’s so much more!\nQuick hits:\n\nIndieAuth: This is a protocol based on OAuth 2. The plugin establishes an endpoint in the WordPress REST API that can be used to authenticate your identity through your own self-hosted site — essentially your own Google sign-in button but without establishing that endpoint yourself or needing to rely on a separate hosted API.\n\nMicropub: For those who use WordPress but prefer a different editor can install the Micropub plugin. This adds an endpoint that allows you to publish content to your site and using a Micropub-supported editor create items in a Microformats2 feed, giving you way more options for writing content outside of the WordPress Block Editor.\n\nSimple Location: David wrote this plugin and I was super impressed when he demoed it for me. The idea is it pulls in data from your current location that can used for everything from displaying the weather at the time you wrote a post, to creating an entire archive of posts on an embedded map based on the post location. I’d honestly love to see something like this baked directly into WordPress.\nThe updated flow\nI attempted to make an illustration that outlines the various pieces in my last post, but let’s try again with an updated understanding of what’s happening:\n(Full size)Is this all making sense?\nHigh fives to David for both reaching out and taking the time to show me what it looks like to implement IndieWeb on WordPress. I can’t claim I fully understand all the nuances, but I at least feel like I have a decent grasp of the pieces — the philosophy, protocols, and tech — that are required to make it happen.\nI’d like to turn it around to you!

      "content": {
        "html": "<p>Reading Miriam Suzanne’s <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">excellent article</a> on the complexity of implementing Webmentions got me thinking about the IndieWeb again. I stepped away from social media a while back, but the one thing I’ve consistently missed is having a way to record all the little moments that make up who I am. Since I’m on break from classes and teaching, I decided to challenge myself by adding Webmentions to my own site and documenting the process. Hopefully it’ll help someone else out!</p><h2>Step one: Choose a tech stack</h2><p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/de-mystifying-indieweb-on-a-wordpress-site/\">I’m told this is a lot easier if you use WordPress or a CMS</a>. That said, despite WordPress being my day-job-specialty, the last evidence of WordPress on my personal site is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161010003336/http://lastletterdesign.com/\">over here on archive.org</a>. So here we are: the tough road. I promise it’s not as tough as it looks.</p><p>These days (and by these days, I really mean “a decision I made six years ago that I haven’t had time to change yet”), I use <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> to generate a static site. I didn’t want to redesign my entire website to try out Webmentions, so I chose a few online services that paired nicely with my setup. Tech stacks are always a negotiation between personal preference, your current knowledge, how much rework you want to do, and in my case, the path of least pain. I feel very at home with HTML, CSS, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a>, and GitHub Actions, so my tech stack is based around those:</p><ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> (for site generation)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/\">Netlify CMS</a> (for content management)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://indielogin.com/\">IndieLogin</a> (for login)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> (for syndication)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> (for hosting - <a href=\"https://cnly.github.io/2018/04/14/just-3-steps-adding-netlify-cms-to-existing-github-pages-site-within-10-minutes.html\">this</a> is how I added Netlify CMS)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub Actions</a> (for deployment)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> (for receiving and testing receiving)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://webmention.app/\">Webmention.app</a> (for sending)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://webmention.rocks/\">Webmention.rocks</a> (for testing sending)</li>\n</ul><p>If you’re on a static site generator, great! Keep reading, and swap out your generator, hosting, and deploy technologies as needed. The bones of this setup will still be helpful to you.</p><h2>Step two: Add IndieLogin</h2><p>Logging into <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> is super easy - just use your URL! - <em>if</em> you have IndieLogin set up. Fortunately, it’s super easy to <a href=\"https://indielogin.com/setup\">set up your site to work with IndieLogin</a>. Just add <code>rel=\"me\"</code> to your social media links, and you’ll be able to authenticate with your existing social media services.</p><h2>Step three: Connect Webmention.io to your site</h2><p>When you log in, you’ll find a settings page with some code somewhat like this, but specific to your username:</p><pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span><span>&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"webmention\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"https://webmention.io/username/webmention\"</span> /&gt;\n</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"pingback\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"https://webmention.io/username/xmlrpc\"</span> /&gt;\n</span></span></code></pre><p>I added my personalized version of that code into the head tag of my website.</p><h2>Step four: Test that a Webmention elsewhere shows for you</h2><p>Luckily, <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> comes with a handy dandy form at the endpoint for you to test this with. Head on over to your personalized Webmention link from above, and you’ll see a simple form to send a happy little mention on over to yourself, Bob Ross-style.</p><p>The source URL will be a page that mentions something about you, and the target URL will be the page that the Webmention should be associated with. Perhaps you already have a mention out there you’re aware of. If you are me, you don’t because you deleted all your social media and most people didn’t know you existed in the first place, making this without question the most difficult part of the entire IndieWeb implementation process.</p><p>I digress.</p><p>In these cases, perhaps it’s clearest to <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/learning-to-love-hugo/\">just Webmention yourself</a>. I wanted <a href=\"https://github.com/voxpelli/node-webmention-testpinger\">node-webmention-testpinger</a> to work so badly, but I couldn’t get it to work like I expected.

If, like me, your problems are more centered around people <em>not</em> knowing about you, adding the ability to send Webmentions is one way to fix that.

In my case, it’s a blog post, so I chose to use the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry\">h-entry microformat</a>. After taking a look at my markup, I needed to add an <code>h-entry</code> class around my entire blog post, a <code>p-name</code> class to my title, a <code>p-author</code> to show that I am (indeed) the author of the post, an <code>h-card</code> which talks a bit more about me (I’ll expand on that in a moment), a <code>u-url</code> class as well as my permalink, and a <code>dt-published</code> class.</p><h2>Step six: Add an h-card</h2><p>An h-card lets the web know (programmatically) who you are as a person.

Since I’m using Hugo, I followed <a href=\"https://digitaldrummerj.me/hugo-create-rss-feed/\">Justin James’s excellent instructions</a> to add an RSS feed template to my Hugo theme. Adding the default template will enable a feed for every content type, <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/index.xml\">like so</a>, and it will also automatically enable feeds based on a category, such as <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/categories/design/index.xml\">this site’s design RSS feed</a>. Right now, I don’t have images in the feed. I’ll add images to my RSS feed later, since I don’t need that to test Webmentions.</p><h2>Step nine: Set up automatic Webmentions notifications</h2><p>A good next step is to test that your new Webmentions functionality shows up properly for someone else. I took inspiration from <a href=\"https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-10-13-sending-webmentions-from-a-static-website\">James Mead’s awesome instructions</a> to do this with <a href=\"https://webmention.app/\">https://webmention.app/</a>.</p><p>In his instructions, James abstracted the sending script to <a href=\"https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions\">its own GitHub repo</a> and watched for changes to the RSS feed. But since I’m already <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action\">building Hugo with a GitHub Action to host on GitHub Pages</a>, I know exactly when my RSS feed has been rebuilt, and it’s at the end of my action. That’s the approach I’m going to take here.</p><p>First, install the webmention.app CLI by running <code>npm install @remy/webmention --save-dev</code> in your project’s folder. I used this to test Webmentions locally before adding them to the GitHub action.</p><p>Then, run <code>npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --debug</code> using your RSS feed URL to see if your latest post has a valid webmention without actually sending it. Once you’ve verified you have valid Webmentions to send out, you can add the CLI command to your GitHub Actions script.</p><p>The action itself is very simple—just add the same commands you’d run locally. Don’t forget to switch out the URL if you’re an avid copy/paster like I am.</p><pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span><span>- <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">name</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">Install Dependencies</span>\n</span></span><span><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">run</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">npm install</span>\n</span></span><span><span>- <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">name</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">Test Webmentions</span>\n</span></span><span><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">run</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --send</span>\n</span></span></code></pre><h2>Step ten: Test that your Webmention shows elsewhere</h2><p>To test if the Webmention actually shows on test content, I used <a href=\"https://webmention.rocks\">https://webmention.rocks</a>. Each of the links on their homepage tests a different type of HTML that could be used to create a Webmention. I used Test 1 to find out if my test post correctly sent a Webmention through Webmention.io. It went through completely smoothly and without a hitch right away.</p><p>Kidding.</p><p>Realistically, this took me several tries to figure out. My advice is to take a close look at your microformats, and use the <a href=\"https://pin13.net/mf2/\">pin13 microformats parser</a> to help with debugging. One thing I found out as a result of this is that it looks like Webmentions don’t duplicate if you push them out multiple times using webmention.app—they just update.</p><h2>Bonus time: Add support to Hugo for inline attributes</h2><p>If you want to add classes to your Markdown, you can update <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#goldmark\">Hugo’s Markdown renderer, Goldmark</a>, to do that. Set <code>block</code> to <code>true</code>, and then add your attributes or classes to any block you like in your Markdown. I’m considering using this to add <code>h-cite</code> and <code>u-in-reply-to</code> classes to <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/in-reply-to\">add context around my mentions</a> where it makes sense, such as where I’m extending an idea. My thinking is this is generally similar to displaying a tweet. I don’t know if this is actually a good idea since this is my first time trying this out, though. If you’ve got any thoughts on that, let me know.</p><h2>But wait, Webmentions aren’t showing on this site yet!</h2><p>That’s absolutely right! I’m not at the point where I am actually showing the data for Webmentions on my site yet. That’s because Webmentions can cover a myrid of types of interactions you might take on a social media site. Liking, retweeting, bookmarking, citing, referencing, replying, commenting… the list goes on, and the data can too. Some of these deserve a slightly different user interface treatment, and I don’t know what that is for me yet. I do know it deserves its own post, and from here, you can choose how your mentions show on your website. Happy mentioning!</p>",
        "text": "Reading Miriam Suzanne’s excellent article on the complexity of implementing Webmentions got me thinking about the IndieWeb again. I stepped away from social media a while back, but the one thing I’ve consistently missed is having a way to record all the little moments that make up who I am. Since I’m on break from classes and teaching, I decided to challenge myself by adding Webmentions to my own site and documenting the process. Hopefully it’ll help someone else out!Step one: Choose a tech stackI’m told this is a lot easier if you use WordPress or a CMS. That said, despite WordPress being my day-job-specialty, the last evidence of WordPress on my personal site is over here on archive.org. So here we are: the tough road. I promise it’s not as tough as it looks.These days (and by these days, I really mean “a decision I made six years ago that I haven’t had time to change yet”), I use Hugo to generate a static site. I didn’t want to redesign my entire website to try out Webmentions, so I chose a few online services that paired nicely with my setup. Tech stacks are always a negotiation between personal preference, your current knowledge, how much rework you want to do, and in my case, the path of least pain. I feel very at home with HTML, CSS, npm, and GitHub Actions, so my tech stack is based around those:\nHugo (for site generation)\n\nNetlify CMS (for content management)\n\nIndieLogin (for login)\n\nRSS (for syndication)\n\nGitHub Pages (for hosting - this is how I added Netlify CMS)\n\nGitHub Actions (for deployment)\n\nWebmention.io (for receiving and testing receiving)\n\nWebmention.app (for sending)\n\nWebmention.rocks (for testing sending)\nIf you’re on a static site generator, great! Keep reading, and swap out your generator, hosting, and deploy technologies as needed. The bones of this setup will still be helpful to you.Step two: Add IndieLoginLogging into Webmention.io is super easy - just use your URL! - if you have IndieLogin set up. Fortunately, it’s super easy to set up your site to work with IndieLogin. Just add rel=\"me\" to your social media links, and you’ll be able to authenticate with your existing social media services.Step three: Connect Webmention.io to your siteWhen you log in, you’ll find a settings page with some code somewhat like this, but specific to your username:<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/username/webmention\" />\n<link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"https://webmention.io/username/xmlrpc\" />\nI added my personalized version of that code into the head tag of my website.Step four: Test that a Webmention elsewhere shows for youLuckily, Webmention.io comes with a handy dandy form at the endpoint for you to test this with. Head on over to your personalized Webmention link from above, and you’ll see a simple form to send a happy little mention on over to yourself, Bob Ross-style.The source URL will be a page that mentions something about you, and the target URL will be the page that the Webmention should be associated with. Perhaps you already have a mention out there you’re aware of. If you are me, you don’t because you deleted all your social media and most people didn’t know you existed in the first place, making this without question the most difficult part of the entire IndieWeb implementation process.I digress.In these cases, perhaps it’s clearest to just Webmention yourself. I wanted node-webmention-testpinger to work so badly, but I couldn’t get it to work like I expected. Let me know if you can get it to work and how, because I love the variety of formats it tests.In my case, the source was this post’s URL, and the target was https://ashleykolodziej.com/learning-to-love-hugo/. After you submit the form and see a “pending” message, give it a refresh. With luck, you’ll see it change to “Success”!Head back on over to your dashboard at Webmention.io, and you’ll see a brandy-new Webmention.Step five: Add microformat classes to your contentI noticed many posts stop right around getting other people’s Webmentions to your website, which sure seems like the type of thing you could get away with doing if people knew about you. If, like me, your problems are more centered around people not knowing about you, adding the ability to send Webmentions is one way to fix that. And to do that, we need to do some markup work so the right data is going out with these mentions.First, identify the type of content you’re likely to create a Webmention with, and then take a look at the Microformats specification to see which microformat matches best. In my case, it’s a blog post, so I chose to use the h-entry microformat. After taking a look at my markup, I needed to add an h-entry class around my entire blog post, a p-name class to my title, a p-author to show that I am (indeed) the author of the post, an h-card which talks a bit more about me (I’ll expand on that in a moment), a u-url class as well as my permalink, and a dt-published class.Step six: Add an h-cardAn h-card lets the web know (programmatically) who you are as a person. This standardized markup is what allows other websites using Webmentions to show your name and avatar next to mentions or comments. I used MDN’s excellent h-card example as a starting point for a card to add my own to the bottom of all my posts. It’s pretty simple to build and modify—just add any h-card supported property as a class to your HTML, and other IndieWeb users will get a nicely structured JSON object about you and who you are when you send a Webmention.I chose to leave out the physical address and keep my email discoverable, and add a rel=\"author\" attribute since I use this website to write articles. I also followed Aaron Parecki’s lead regarding bios by using the p-note class to wrap around my entire bio.I was curious if the parser would pick up any data that is generally structured with these types of classes, so I added a p-pronouns class, which isn’t officially supported, to see if it would.<aside class=\"p-author h-card\">\n    <h2>About the author</h2>\n    <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/img/profile.jpg\" \n    alt=\"A white woman with with glasses and long, curled blonde hair at a \n    park, wearing a colorful dress and smiling.\" />\n    <p class=\"p-note\">\n        <a rel=\"author\" class=\"p-name u-url\" \n        href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com\">Ashley Kolodziej</a> \n        (<span class=\"p-pronouns\">she/her/hers</span>) is an \n        <span class=\"p-job-title\">Associate Creative Director</span> in \n        <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/interactive-design/\" class=\"p-org\">\n        Boston University's Interactive Design department</a>.

You can reach her at <a class=\"u-email\" href=\"\n        mailto:ashley@lastletterdesign.com\">ashley@lastletterdesign.com</a>.\n    </p>\n</aside>\nStep seven: Test your h-cardThe pin13 microformats parser lets you test either a live URL or the HTML. When I tested this blog post, I was excited to see that I was right—my pronouns were listed among the properties!It’s up to the folks who implement webmentions on their websites what they want to do with the data from here, and as always, you should check if something existing can be used in the spec to mark up your data.

It’s also neat to see that the parser automatically grabbed the src and alt attributes from my photo and structured them nicely in the JSON.{\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": [\n                \"h-card\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"note\": [\n                    \"Ashley Kolodziej (she/her/hers) is an Associate\n                     Creative Director in Boston University's Interactive \n                     Design department.

Since I’m using Hugo, I followed Justin James’s excellent instructions to add an RSS feed template to my Hugo theme. Adding the default template will enable a feed for every content type, like so, and it will also automatically enable feeds based on a category, such as this site’s design RSS feed. Right now, I don’t have images in the feed. I’ll add images to my RSS feed later, since I don’t need that to test Webmentions.Step nine: Set up automatic Webmentions notificationsA good next step is to test that your new Webmentions functionality shows up properly for someone else. I took inspiration from James Mead’s awesome instructions to do this with https://webmention.app/.In his instructions, James abstracted the sending script to its own GitHub repo and watched for changes to the RSS feed. But since I’m already building Hugo with a GitHub Action to host on GitHub Pages, I know exactly when my RSS feed has been rebuilt, and it’s at the end of my action. That’s the approach I’m going to take here.First, install the webmention.app CLI by running npm install @remy/webmention --save-dev in your project’s folder. I used this to test Webmentions locally before adding them to the GitHub action.Then, run npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --debug using your RSS feed URL to see if your latest post has a valid webmention without actually sending it. Once you’ve verified you have valid Webmentions to send out, you can add the CLI command to your GitHub Actions script.The action itself is very simple—just add the same commands you’d run locally. Don’t forget to switch out the URL if you’re an avid copy/paster like I am.- name: Install Dependencies\n  run: npm install\n- name: Test Webmentions\n  run: npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --send\nStep ten: Test that your Webmention shows elsewhereTo test if the Webmention actually shows on test content, I used https://webmention.rocks. Each of the links on their homepage tests a different type of HTML that could be used to create a Webmention. I used Test 1 to find out if my test post correctly sent a Webmention through Webmention.io. It went through completely smoothly and without a hitch right away.Kidding.Realistically, this took me several tries to figure out. My advice is to take a close look at your microformats, and use the pin13 microformats parser to help with debugging. One thing I found out as a result of this is that it looks like Webmentions don’t duplicate if you push them out multiple times using webmention.app—they just update.Bonus time: Add support to Hugo for inline attributesIf you want to add classes to your Markdown, you can update Hugo’s Markdown renderer, Goldmark, to do that. Set block to true, and then add your attributes or classes to any block you like in your Markdown. I’m considering using this to add h-cite and u-in-reply-to classes to add context around my mentions where it makes sense, such as where I’m extending an idea. My thinking is this is generally similar to displaying a tweet. I don’t know if this is actually a good idea since this is my first time trying this out, though. If you’ve got any thoughts on that, let me know.But wait, Webmentions aren’t showing on this site yet!That’s absolutely right! I’m not at the point where I am actually showing the data for Webmentions on my site yet. That’s because Webmentions can cover a myrid of types of interactions you might take on a social media site. Liking, retweeting, bookmarking, citing, referencing, replying, commenting… the list goes on, and the data can too. Some of these deserve a slightly different user interface treatment, and I don’t know what that is for me yet. I do know it deserves its own post, and from here, you can choose how your mentions show on your website. Happy mentioning!"
