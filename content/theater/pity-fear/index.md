  **What does it mean to be a person** --
  to have a body, and live in it --
  to make choices, and change over time --
  to tell the truth?

**Pity+Fear**
in an intimate and darkly comic
attempt at a one-woman tragedy,
featuring two women and a guitar.
Over the course of the evening,
Miriam & Josie fail to grapple with queer identity,
platonic realism,
the conflicting myths of Agraulos,
and what to order for dinner.

> There are no new ideas.
