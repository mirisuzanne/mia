      Pity+Fear (a travesty) was,
      beginning to end,
      incisive, insightful, sensitive
      and at keen times humorous
      without trivializing anyone’s struggles and challenges.

  **What does it mean to be a person** --
  to have a body, and live in it --
  to make choices, and change over time --
  to tell the truth?

------

**Pity+Fear**
in an intimate and darkly comic
attempt at a one-woman tragedy,
featuring two women and a guitar.
Over the course of the evening,
Miriam & Josie fail to grapple with queer identity,
platonic realism,
the conflicting myths of Agraulos,
and what to order for dinner.

- Fridays & Saturdays, May 13-28 @ 7:20pm
- Buntport Theater, 717 Lipan St, Denver
