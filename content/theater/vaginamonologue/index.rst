******************************************
Trans Vagina Monologue: My Body, My Gender
******************************************

  The Vagina Monologues never intended
  to be a play about what it means to be a woman.
  It is and always has been a play about what it means to have a vagina.

  --`Eve Ensler <http://time.com/3672912/eve-ensler-vagina-monologues-mount-holyoke-college/>`_

In 2004,
Eve Ensler wrote a trans monologue
for a cast of 5 trans women.
I imagine they had a wide range of genital shapes and sizes,
but what do I know.
I imagine the monologue for trans men got lost in the mail. [1]_

That official trans-femme monologue is titled
"They Beat The Girl Out Of My Boy… Or So They Tried" --
which you can find online if you're interested.
It's full of pain and violence,
beatings, medical interventions,
and eventually surgery.
It's based on true stories,
but the 5-voice structure is very impersonal,
and somehow still results in a `singular narrative`_. [2]_

But that story is not my story,
so we agreed that I should write a new one.
Here it is,
my rouge monologue --
performed as part of the
brilliant production
by `It Grows Wild`_ theater company.
It was a real pleasure
to work with such a great
group of women.

Despite undergoing bottom surgery recently,
I didn't want to perpetuate a
narrative that *surgery makes us women*.
Instead,
this monologue is almost entirely based
on my pre-surgery experience
of having an "inverted" vagina.

In my mind the subtitle should be:
`Why Is No One Talking About The Mouthfeel?`_
Parts of it
(especially the opening)
will be familiar
if you've read my work.
Most of it is new material.

.. [1] I don't assume trans men *want* a monologue,
   but they do also, sometimes, have vaginas…
.. [2] Ironically,
   after bemoaning the dangers of a single story,
   Chimamanda Adichie
   still rejects trans womanhood
   because it doesn’t fit her narrative…
