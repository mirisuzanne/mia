In 2004,
Eve Ensler wrote a trans monologue
for a cast of 5 trans women.
I imagine they had a wide range of genital shapes and sizes,
but what do I know.
I imagine the monologue for trans men got lost in the mail. [^1]

That official trans-femme monologue is titled
"They Beat The Girl Out Of My Boy… Or So They Tried" --
which you can find online if you're interested.
It's full of pain and violence,
beatings, medical interventions,
and eventually surgery.
It's based on true stories,
but the 5-voice structure is very impersonal,
and somehow still results in a [singular narrative][narrative]. [^2]

But that story is not my story,
so we agreed that I should write a new one.
Here it is,
my rogue monologue --
performed as part of the
brilliant production
by [It Grows Wild][igw] theater company.
It was a real pleasure
to work with such a great
group of women.

Despite undergoing bottom surgery recently,
I didn't want to perpetuate a
narrative that *surgery makes us women*.
Instead,
this monologue is almost entirely based
on my pre-surgery experience
of having an "inverted" vagina.

Parts of it
(especially the opening)
will be familiar
if you've read my work.
Most of it is new material.

[^1]: I don't assume trans men *want* a monologue --
but they do, also, sometimes, have vaginas…

[^2]: Ironically,
after bemoaning the dangers of a single story,
Chimamanda Adichie
still rejects trans womanhood
because it doesn’t fit her narrative…
