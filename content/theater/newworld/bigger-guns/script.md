## Scene 1: Hostages

*The doors of the theatre don't open and don't open and they still
aren't open. People with headsets and/or walkie-talkies and/or guns
occasionally run through the lobby or sneak through talking into their
lapels or mumbling and touching their ears. First one, then several,
then none and none and none and lots and only one and then silence.
The show should have started by now.*

*If there are extras mingling with the audience they aren't in
character. when their friends ask 'aren't you in the show?' they say
'yes' and 'you see - the script calls for -' and 'it's just like them
here at NWA, always doing things like that' and something about the
atmosphere of the show and meta-theatre and surprising the audience.*

*Then the lights go out and it is absolutely dark and silent. There is
a crash and some giggling, a cough and silence again. Then
flashlights. First one then all around, or first all around and then
one. Are they looking for something? Someone? Or are they just
scanning the crowd? All at once they all focus on Chain Daisysaw who
says:*

**Chain:**
Boo.

*And presses the button on a bomb that will blow everyone to kingdom
come as the lights all go off. There is a silence and some giggling
again and a pause and the lights are turned back on. Chain is shaking
the bomb and hitting it on her palm, jiggling it to get it working.
She looks up sheepishly. As sheepishly as any super-villain can look
up at her would-be victims after a failed explosion.*

**Chain:**
Anyone have a screwdriver? Or a lighter? Or a bomb, or something?

*No one does, but someone offers her a knife or a spork or both*

**Chain:**
Right well. Make do, I always say. Killer!

*Killer, her sidekick, steps out of the crowd*

**Killer:**
Yes Boss.

**Chain:**
Take them hostage.

**Killer:**
I thought you were going to kill them.

**Chain:**
Plan B.

**Killer:**
What's my cue?

**Chain:**
This is your cue.

*She points a gun at Killer's head*

**Killer:**
You heard the boss - MOVE!

*Killer shuffles everyone into the theatre*

**Killer:**
Into the theatre. Sit. Sit. Anywhere. Does it look like I give a damn?
Take a seat. Enjoy the show. DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. Welcome,
welcome. I SAID SIT.

*Killer gives the New World intro speech, followed by:*

**Killer:**
You've been taken hostage, so do what you're told - no funny business.

*She looks around to make sure Chain is gone*

**Killer:**
Sorry about all that. That wasn't supposed to be in this play at all.
That was a flashback to Bigger Guns II: The Decider: Decide Harder. I
think it also happened in Bigger Guns One: The Really Very Last Stand,
but they start to blur you know... It's hard to think of new plots for
these things...

**Chain (OFF):**
Killer!

**Killer:**
Well, Evil calls. Thank you, and enjoy the show.

*Killer exits*

------

## Scene 2: Lost Keys

*Through all of this, Daisy is on stage (at her home) in Samurai
meditation with her sword. The lights go down on the audience and she
finishes her ritual, returning her sword carefully to the proper place
on it's rack. Then she exits and returns in uniform for the shoe store
where she works, buttoning the final buttons and straightening the
last crinkles and pins. Everything is in place for her first day of
work.*

**Daisy:**
What am I forgetting? What am I forgetting? What am I forgetting?

*She pats herself down, turns in a circle to look around the room.
Clarence enters.*

**Clarence:**
You're keys again?

*She has a British accent*

**Daisy:**
Where did I - ?

**Clarence:**
Here. They were in the sink.

*They look at each other for a moment. Why the sink? Daisy grabs her
keys, touches the sword or something else for good luck and heads out
the door*

**Daisy:**
Thanks.

------

## Scene 3: Work

*Harry is at the store counting money in the cash register when Daisy
enters, obviously a little late and a little nervous. This might all
be video footage...*

**Harry:**
Hi. Great. Come on in.

*He has a vaguely foreign accent that keeps changing*

**Daisy:**
I'm sorry, I -

**Harry:**
Daisy, right? You're early. You're just in time. Come come come.
Harry. Hi.

*Harry begins to show her around the store. Orienting her to the cash
register and the shelves and shoes and everything she needs*

**Harry:**
It's so good to have you working for us.

**Daisy:**
Thanks, it's a big help for me you know - getting this job.

**Harry:**
Oh, it's really no problem. So you're a... Decorator you said?
Interior -

**Daisy:**
Landscaper.

**Harry:**
Oh yes. Sorry.

**Daisy:**
Yes well. I wanted to be a lumberjack, but the pay wasn't very good.

**Harry:**
You don't say.

**Daisy:**
I do.

**Harry:**
And landscaping?

**Daisy:**
Slow in the off-season. Thanks for the job.

**Harry:**
My pleasure. Absolutely. Well, Looks like you have the ropes. I've got
to take off, you know. Busy life being a shoe exec. If you need
anything just ring.

*He points to a red phone with a single red button on it*

**Harry:**
Just in emergencies of course.

*He exits. On his way out his phone rings*

------

## Scene 4: Bribes

*The scene has changed and now we see Chain silhouetted against
anything really talking into a phone. She is sitting behind a desk
with her feat up and a cigar. The Mayor is sitting quietly and
obediently in another chair. During the conversation, Killer drags
some hapless nobody in. Chain looks at the nobody and makes a
dismissive motion with her hand. Killer drags the person backstage and
we hear horrible (though unexpected) noises as they are eliminated*

**Chain:**
Harry. I've got the Mayor. No, the Mayor. Mr. uh - Kauffman right?

*The Mayor nods*

**Chain:**
Mayor Kauffman. Alan Kauffman, yeah. No, I have him right here. Yeah,
he'll do it.

*The Mayor nods. Chain throws a nickel out on the floor and the Mayor
scoops it up.*

**Chain:**
You got the shoes? Backorder? Fine, just get them to me, it's
important. Don't ask, just do. I need them. What about Daisy? If you
can't beat 'em higher 'em - isn't that right, mayor?

*Another nod, another nickel*

------

## Scene 5: Robbery

*Back in the store, after some time two goons enter and look around at
the shoes. They are doing a poor job of pretending they aren't
super-evil villains.*

**Daisy:**
Can I, uh, help you two?

**Goons:**
Yeah/No.

*They hit each other*

**Goons:**
No/Yeah.

**Goon One:**
You can run and hide, little girl.

**Goon Two:**
Yeah - We're the boogy man. Boo.

*They laugh*

**Daisy:**
Well. Would you like some, um, shoes?

**Goons:**
Yeah/No.

*They hit each other*

**Goons:**
No/Yeah.

*They laugh*

**Goon Two:**
We don't need your little girl help, little girl.

**Goon One:**
That's right, little girly girl.

**Goon Two:**
Girl.

**Goon One:**
I think these are them.

**Goon Two:**
They have the right laces?

**Goon One:**
Yeah.

**Goon Two:**
Yeah, that's 'em all right. Let's go.

**Goon One:**
We want these shoes little girl. But we don't want to pay for them.

**Goon Two:**
No we don't.

**Goon One:**
Our boss told us not to.

**Goon Two:**
Yes she did.

*Goon One slaps Goon Two*

**Goon Two:**
Yes he did.
May he rest in peace.

*They laugh, and start to leave with the shoes (in a shoe box of
course). Daisy steps in front of them like any good hero*

**Daisy:**
Well this is you're lucky day.

**Goon One:**
It is?

**Daisy:**
No.

*She knocks their heads together, grabs the box and runs towards the
phone. Chase scene. They get the box back. She is chasing them, but
she trips - and it looks like she has really hurt herself. she lies
still. they lean over to see if she's all right and she jumps up and
grabs the shoe box and runs to the back of the store. They chase her
around for a bit, when Harry enters. Everyone chases everyone with the
shoe box flying around in an intricate game of keep-away where it's
not entirely clear who is chasing whom. Daisy throws to Harry and the
box is easily intercepted by a goon.*

**Goon One:**
You throw like a little girly girl.

**Daisy:**
I kick like one too.

*She kicks Goon One who flies against the back wall. She goes to kick
Goon Two, but he ducks and she kicks Harry, who was sneaking up
behind. She has quite a kick. There is more fighting in which Daisy is
doing all the work and Harry is just in the way. At some point, while
she is helping Harry out, the goons get away with the box.*

**Harry:**
You've got some kick.

------

## Scene 6: Replacement

*Somewhere else: The goons*

**Goon One:**
Stop. We're good.

**Goon Two:**
We're great.

**Goon One:**
I mean we got away.

**Goon Two:**
We're the best.

**Goon One:**
Let me see the box.

**Goon Two:**
What box?

**Goon One:**
The shoe box, you idiot. The one we stole.

**Goon Two:**
I thought you had it.

**Goon One:**
I don't have it!

**Goon Two:**
We must have dropped it.

**Goon One:**
You must have dropped it! The Boss's going to kill you!

**Goon Two:**
No she isn't. Follow me.

*Someone is packing a shoe box full of special memories, photos etc.
They are interrupted by the goons running through with masks and
grabbing the shoe box away from them and running out*

**Someone:**
Hey! Wait!

*The bad guys turn around and shoot him/her over and over. It's
excessive*

------

## Scene 7: The News

*Clarence and Daisy are watching the news. They have it TiVo'd*

**Harry (Voice on TV):**
It's Harry. Harry P. Zeitgeist.

**Reporter (Voice):**
Right. Mr. Zeitgeist. (I feel like I've seen you before...) You say
you were robbed.

**Harry (Voice):**
Very. They almost killed my new employee. I had to save her. Look what
they did to my face. But I fought them off. Gave 'em hell. I'm quite a
fighter. I've been on the cover of Fortune 500.

**Daisy:**
Liar... Wait a second. Wait. Stop it. Go Back. Is that you in the back
there?

**Clarence:**
Yeah, that's me.

**Daisy:**
What are you carrying?

**Clarence:**
A box of shoes. I found them on the street and gave them back to the
poor man.

**Daisy:**
I'll bet you did.

*She hits play again*

**Harry (Voice):**
...had to save her. Look what they did to my face. But I fought them
off. Gave 'em hell. I'm quite a fighter. I've been on the cover of
Fortune 500.

**Reporter (Voice):**
For fighting?

**Harry (Voice):**
For selling.

**Reporter (Voice):**
Did anyone else witness the theft? Are you a witness? What's your
name?

**Clarence: (Voice)**
Clarence. X. The 'X' is for 'Xena'. Witness of what?

**Reporter (Voice):**
Harry, can you say what it is exactly that you do?

**Harry (Voice):**
My work is a search for personal truth in an age of chaos.

**Reporter (Voice):**
Selling shoes?

**Harry (Voice):**
That's a bit pejorative, don't you think?

**Reporter (Voice):**
You consider yourself part of the current zeitgeist?

**Harry (Voice):**
I am the current Zeitgeist. I'm the only Zeitgeist... What is that?

**Clarence: (Voice)**
Shoes. I found them.

**Harry (Voice):**
Can I have those? Excuse me...

**Clarence: (Voice)**
Is the store closed?

**Harry (Voice):**
Yes. Yes it is.

**Reporter (Voice):**
Well that's--

Daisy turns off the TV

**Daisy:**
Shoes.

## Scene 8: Wrong Box

*Chain Daisysaw is silhouetted against something in a very nice office,
possibly with a cat in her lap on a large rolling office chair - just
like any good bad-guy super-boss would - behind a desk. Is she smoking
a cigar or filing her nails or both? Is she filling out tax forms in
triplicate?*

A VOICE
Boss. Goons.

**Chain:**
Let them in.

*Does she sound strangely like The Godfather? The goons enter*

**Chain:**
Where is it?

**Goons:**
Right here, Boss.

**Chain:**
What's this?

**Goons:**
The shoe box.

**Chain:**
Inside it.

**Goons:**
Shoes?

**Chain:**
Look you idiots!

**Goons:**
Looks like old photos and some letters. Christmas cards. A broken
watch.

**Chain:**
This is the wrong box. Killer!

*Killer enters, cracking her knuckles*

**Chain:**
Hurt them.

*Killer does - a la the Stooges more than anything. Some slapstick
clown routine*

**Chain:**
Take them away.

*Killer does, and then returns*

**Chain:**
Who's all this?

**Killer:**
Audience, Boss.

**Chain:**
What are they doing here?

**Killer:**
Just watching, Boss. Paying customers.

**Chain:**
I don't like them. They know too much.

**Killer:**
Yes Boss.

*Killer picks another audience member and hurts them a la WWE wrestling*

**Chain:**
Take them hostage. They might be useful.

**Killer:**
We already did.

**Chain:**
Well do it again!

**Killer:**
Yes Boss.

*Killer does*

------

## Scene 9: Calling Mom

*Harry is in his room crying on the phone*

**Harry:**
I just can't handle it sometimes, mom.
All the pressure. I'm haunted by my dreams. Ever since I made the
cover of Fortune 500. No, I know. You always say that. You're my
mother! Well, it's not easy representing an entire generation while
running a shoe store. I know Dad did it. I know. Why do you always
bring that up? Mom. Mom. I've got another call I have to take. Mom!
Ok. Love you too. Bye. (presses some buttons) Zeitgeist. We represent.
Yeah. Oh yeah. No. Crying? Me? No. No. Not at all. Yeah, I have them
right here. Mauve? Sounds good. All of them? You're the boss. Hello?
Hello? Damn, why can't she ever just say 'goodbye'?

------

## Scene 10: Inspiration

*Daisy and Clarence. Daisy is lifting weights and doing samurai
rituals. Clarence is reading a book.*

**Clarence:**
You don't have to do this, you know.

**Daisy:**
I do.

**Clarence:**
It could have been a one-off.

**Daisy:**
It wasn't a one-off.

**Clarence:**
But Shoes?

**Daisy:**
Not just any shoes.

**Clarence:**
Still, could have been a coincidence.

**Daisy:**
The signature green shoelaces. She has to be behind it.

**Clarence:**
You can't mean...

**Daisy:**
Dr. Daisysaw.

**Clarence:**
Chain...

*And then it hits her!*

**Daisy:**
Harry P Zeitgeist! A THREE RIG ZIT SPY!

**Clarence:**
or A RITZY SHEET PRIG. What does that mean?

**Daisy:**
It means I have to go.

She starts to put her shoes on

**Clarence:**
Are those new shoes?

**Daisy:**
I got them today. You like them?

*She leaves*

and get out their planners*

## Scene 17: Date

*Clarence on a date with Harry in a cafe. She is being overheard by
Killer on some super-spy equipment*

**Clarence:**
So. This is a date.

**Harry:**
Yep.

**Clarence:**
Okay. What do we do?

**Harry:**
We order dinner.

**Clarence:**
Are you paying?

**Harry:**
Sure.

**Clarence:**
Iâ€™d rather pay.

**Harry:**
Okay.

**Clarence:**
What else do we do?

**Harry:**
Itâ€™s like a business meeting, except we talk about everything
else besides business.

**Clarence:**
What else is there?

**Harry:**
In theory, nothing. But generally, you talk about
your friends, your family, stuff you like to do,
culture.

**Clarence:**
My father stepped on a landmine. He died in three
places. So my mother sold me to a brothel.
Upwards of one thousand men. The rough ones
liked me â€˜cause I tried to fight back.

*Pause*

**Harry:**
That doesnâ€™t matter to me.

**Clarence:**
It matters to me.

*Pause*

What. Uhm. What do you want?

Oh.

How nice. I solved the crime.

**Clarence:**
Did you?

**Daisy:**
Yeah, look at this.

*She hands Clarence a diagram*

**Clarence:**
Fluoridation.

**Daisy:**
That's right.

**Clarence:**
This is quite a plot.

**Daisy:**
Sure is. Even the Mayor is in on it. He passes the bill to make us all
paint our houses. And we all have to by our paint from the same store.
Cosy Appeal. Only if you mix up the letters, that spells apocalypse,
see.

**Clarence:**
Clever. And the shoes?

**Daisy:**
Laced with fluoride to spike the paint.

**Clarence:**
Wow. They think of everything.

**Daisy:**
They are the bad guys.

**Clarence:**
I'll say.

**Daisy:**
I'd better go finish this off.

**Clarence:**
You'd better. Let me know how that goes.

*Daisy exits. Clarence goes into the other room and comes back with a
suitcase and exits as well*

------

## Scene 20: Birthday Party

*A birthday party with Chain and Harry and the Goons and Chain's little
adopted sister through the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. At the
same: Daisy loading herself up with various small weapons. the
partyers sing happy birthday and bring out a cup cake while Daisy
makes a phone call*

**Daisy:**
Hello, Houston? \
Can you put me through to good-guy headquarters? \
Yeah it's me. \
Daisy. \
Yeah.

*Pause - she's on hold*

**Daisy:**
Yeah \
Daisy \
We need bigger guns. \
No, really really bigger.

*she gestures to show how big*

**Daisy:**
OK. \
Backorder? \
Really? \
Can we get them from a different supplier? \
OK. \
No, that's OK. \
No, I'll make do. \
Thanks.

*She hangs up. The party continues. Daisy disappears*

**Chain:**
Open the gifts! Open the gifts! Here, this one is from me.

*Daisy bursts in on the party*

**Daisy:**
Party's over. Throw up those hands.

**Chain & Harry:**
Daisy Chainsaw!

**Chain:**
Did you invite her?

**Harry:**
Me? No.

**Daisy:**
Let's cut the chit chat. Where are the shoes?

*Chain and Harry look at each other, then at the box Chain's little
sister was about to open*

**Daisy:**
In the box, eh? I'm on to you people. You can't pull the wool over my
eyes. Hand it over.

**Chain:**
Sally, give Daisy the box.

**Sally:**
But it's my birthday.

**Chain:**
I know dear, but she has bigger guns than we do.

*Sally starts to cry*

**Harry:**
You've made Sally cry on her birthday. Here's the box, now will you
leave?

**Daisy:**
Not on your little life, you THREE RIG ZIT SPY.

**Harry:**
Come again?

**Daisy:**
I'm on to you.

*She opens the box and takes out the shoes. She looks at them. Smells
them. Licks them*

**Chain:**
What are you doing?

**Daisy:**
Smell like shoes. Taste like shoes. Where's the fluoride?

**Chain:**
What fluoride?

**Daisy:**
To paint the houses and take over Goshen.

**Chain:**
You're crazy.

**Harry:**
They're just shoes.

**Chain:**
Not just any shoes.

**Daisy:**
Aha. Out with it.

**Chain:**
These are Green Speed #12, one of eleven ever made, the only size 7.
These are rare and hard to get. These are a birthday present for my
favorite sister, Sally.

**Daisy:**
You never get me anything on my birthday.

**Chain:**
You're not my favorite sister, are you?

**Daisy:**
I'm your only sister! One of one in the world! She's just someone you
picked up off the street!

**Chain:**
Big Brothers, Big Sisters, actually.

**Harry:**
You two are sisters?

**Chain:**
Well, she changed her name and went all crazy on us. 'Chainsaw'? Come
on.

**Daisy:**
It's better than 'Daisysaw', that doesn't make any sense.

**Sally:**
Can I have my shoes?

**Daisy:**
What about the mayor? He was in cahoots with you on this plot too. I
know it.

**Harry:**
You sure know how to ruin a party.

**Chain:**
Mayor!

*The Mayor awkwardly jumps out of a box. He was supposed to be a
surprise*

**Daisy:**
I'm on to you. That legislation to paint our houses - Chain put you up
to that so she could take over Goshen.

**Mayor:**
Chain? No. Chain put me up to jumping out of a box for her little
sister.

**Daisy:**
Someone put you up to it! I know they did!

**Mayor:**
Well it was proposed by the Sisterhood of the Traveling YaYa's of the
Apocalypse.

**Daisy:**
I knew it! Wait. Who's that?

**Mayor:**
I don't know.

*Clarence jumps in with a SuperSoaker full of Green water*

**Clarence:**
Aha, fools!

**Everyone:**
Clarence!

**Clarence:**
Clarence X, the 'X' is for Xena.

**Daisy:**
The Sisterhood of what?

**Clarence:**
Well, it's really just me. It never took off.

**Daisy:**
The Apocalypse! Cosy Appeal!

**Chain:**
Are you serious?

**Harry:**
Only if you spell 'Cozy' with an 's'.

**Clarence:**
Don't you spell 'Cosy' with an 's'?

**Daisy:**
Only if you're... British!

**Clarence:**
HaHA. My little secret has gotten out, has it. Well, you all know to
much. Feel the wrath of the fluoride!

*She sprays everyone and then the audience*

**Clarence:**
That will teach you to come see experimental theatre!

*Daisy jumps on her and they wrestle for a bit*

**Clarence:**
No. No. That's mine. Hey. Give it.

*Daisy ends up on top with the SuperSoaker*

**Daisy:**
Ha. Daisy Chainsaw. The Chainsaw is for Chainsaw.

**Sally:**
This is MY party!

*Everyone turns to look at her*

**Sally:**
Would everyone please sit down now, so I can open my gifts, or leave.

*Everyone does*

**Sally:**
Now where are those gifts?

*Daisy gets the shoes and wraps them back up as well as she can. She
hands them to Sally who opens the box*

**Sally:**
Yay! Shoes! That's just what I wanted! This is the best birthday EVER.
God bless us every one.
