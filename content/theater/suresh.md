  A quartet of souls are brought together

  sharing a hunger for human connection,
  while dreaming of a city
  once consumed by the scourge of war.

Directed by Julie Rada,
my long-time collaborator
at Grapefruit Lab.

Even though I've been doing
light design for most of my career,
this is one of my first experiences as a freelancer:
designing lights for a company that I'm not part of.
It's been fun!
Who knows, maybe I'll do it again.
