OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY
----------------------

*a pristine set
everything in white
a sterile science lab
a repeating tone*

*throughout,
the words are
for the most part
spoken
by actors behind us
lit with scripts and lecterns
as the action plays out in the front and aisles*

*black
silence*

*a hum grows
the tone returns
repeating
there is a voice:*

| and then we separated the inside of our houses
| from the outside of our houses
| we all know the dust cannot be swept from the dirt floor
| we all know the bacteria cannot be scrubbed from our bodies
| from our skin
| from our selves
| and wash it down the drain
| down the hole
| down the mighty mississipp
| the muddy
| the ganges
| down the san andreas
| to the center of the earth
| the universe
| the veins
| in my eye
| wrong
| this ain't grace
| this all fucked
| this old thing
| wrong
| wash me down
| wash me down
| wash me down

*a harsh light
a silhouette
blood on a lab coat
washing hands*

| and from within him stir
| the hell within him
| for within him hell

*a pause*

| please continue

*the washing continues
it becomes jagged and stylized
a repetition of itself
the hum is feedback
there is a scream from all directions
the washing stops
so do the screams
and all sounds
the silence is deafening*

| I can kill you but instead I hold you tight

*the silhouette becomes limp*

| the trash requires that you continue
| the trash requires trash
| continue

*washing / sporadic
screams when the hands are in water
stops
has the water become blood?*

| it is absolutely essential that you continue
| it is absolutely essential
| continue

*the washing is frantic
the screams are frantic
full body*

| it is only a job
| the job requires it
| the job
| there is a speck
| cut
| dissect
| a speck of dust
| cut
| on your father
| cut
| in your shadows and up your ass the contamination
| the cut
| cut out
| you have no choice
| dissect contamination
| it is only right
| it is just
| you have no other choice
| you must go on

*soaked
the body collapses
as do the screams
and the feedback*

| I've never dripped in punishment
| quite
| like
| this

LADY GAGA: PRIEST
-----------------

*an explosion of light
and music
and people
and Lady GaGa
and confetti*

*doors open and slam
objects enter from everywhere
in an orgy of sex/violence/things
people in love and hate
- in embarrassment and humiliation
- sudden grief,  anxiety
- dread
- distraction and envy and greed
- and lust
- an army of pecks
- a liturgy of squawks
- a broken wing
- cobwebs and tongues and elbows, angels and lips
and someone has a shopping cart
full of plastic toys and kitchen accouterment
which they throw one-by-one against the wall
while Lady GaGa sings us this song:*

| I fold you into my mouth
| that goes
| that leaves
| and now i will destroy it all
| I can’t help it
| it all embarrasses me
| and so I’ll fuck it
| and mourn it
| what?
| where was i?
| now now now nownownownownownownownownownownow
| crash
| oops
| crash
| fleeting
| tickle/giggle/fidget and bounce
| a blanket of sadness
| dropped on me from the gods
| from the ghosts of grandmothers and illusions and dead cats
| forget it
| can I put you in my mouth?
| because
| cuz
| I desire it
| drop it
| (I can kill you and take all your money)
| and hold you tight
| just lay on my chest
| feel the comfort of heartbeat in your ear pressed to my skin
| the weightedness
| the love song
| loins
| don’t look
| don’t behold
| me
| mememememememe
| a wish
| I am Prada,
| born among the demons,
| and of all that measures,
| I am time
| I am I am
| the cow that fulfills
| I am
| the power of sex
| and
| the king

*by the end of which
Lady Gaga has jumped from the acropolis
to be carried safely
to a soft landing
on pillows*

AN ARMY OF GOD
--------------

The twin notions of microcosm and macrocosm neatly model the dominant
orienting lens of Western thought. From the pre-Socratics on, thinkers
who contend that they have discovered cosmological truths argue that
man is a little world embodying the structure and traits of the
greater universe. To know the universe, they say, look carefully at
man, and all truth shall be revealed. As man breathes, so does the
universe (Pythagoras). As man fights interior battles between good and
evil, so they must exist on a grander scale (Sir Thomas Browne). And
to affix such a connection: a maker to make cunningly. And so on it
goes.

*other voices and texts join in
they are dictators and groucho marx
and the scum manifesto and tweets
and status update blog post personal diary
literature and everything words:*

Concentric circles in the mind. Interior in conversation with the
exterior (or the inverse), and again and again we are re-creating what
we know most intimately: cyclical motions from the smallest to the
largest scale. Cycles of our hours, our days, the circular motion of
my hand in the air is a mirror to this cycle of All We Have: aka life
(unless we subscribe to the promise of After. Life. And isn't this
promise of Something HereAfter so much of what brings us back,
circling back, week after week, to the Pew, the Alter, the Psalm, the
Incense and the Water, Genuflection at His feet? The promise that, if
we do this right, are appropriately sorrygood, then this is all just
the white-walled waiting room, the cloak room to the AfterLife that
counts?) . Creatures of habit, we find our pattern, conscious of
duplication or un-.

*the voices come and go
forming patterns and rhythms
fighting and joining
soloing at times
and fighting with and against the music
in rhythms and sudden bursts
and building to a unison:*

Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift
our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear. In this,
they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the
resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people - yet we're not a
fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers.
If our enemies dare to strike us, they and all who have aided them,
will face fearful consequences.

We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater.
In one year, or five years, the power of our enemies to inflict harm
on all free nations would be multiplied many times over. With these
capabilities, the dark one and his terrorist allies could choose the
moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet
that threat now, where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our
skies and cities.

The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and
undeniable realities. In the 20th century, some chose to appease
murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide
and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical,
biological and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring
destruction of a kind never before seen on this earth.

Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair
notice, in formal declarations - and responding to such enemies only
after they have struck first is not self-defense, it is suicide. The
security of the world requires disarming The Old Serpent now.

As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the
deepest commitments of our country. Unlike the Author of Evil, we believe
the forgotten people are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when
the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all humanity of a vital
and peaceful and self-governing nation.

The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty
and peace in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but
it can come over time. The power and appeal of human liberty is felt
in every life and every land. And the greatest power of freedom is to
overcome hatred and violence, and turn the creative gifts of men and
women to the pursuits of peace.

That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our
people by uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done
before, America and our allies accept that responsibility.

Good night, and may God continue to bless America.

RIPPLES WHEN YOU STOP
---------------------

*silence*

*more silence*

*lights up
bodies still
in mid-motion
the motion is wrong
the lights go out
and up
wrong
and out up
wrong again
and out*

*a note on the piano
leads to another note
and another*

*a match is lit
and lights a candle
and another
and several candles are lit*

*someone in a bath:*

| I could say I believe in the world today
| that each day will follow the other like pots to pans
| that the cog of my life turns with some precision
| even that when I am dead I will die
| and stay that way
| I know this
| I know the skies
| black
| yellow
| black
| on and on that way
| and the old dragon and his crony angels
| are nowhere to be seen
| looking for guns and gold and gasoline
| I could say that I believe in this
| that it is

*someone else attempting and failing*

*stand up, sit down, kneel
repeat*

*someone making tea or combing hair:*

| on the way home from work
| I got onto i70
| I missed my exit
| but kept driving
| I noticed after an hour or two
| that I was no longer merely driving east
| past gaudy warehouses and outlet stores
| but driving back through years

*while in the bathtub:*

| every day I cut back the rust
| my heart is a muscle
| the only thing
| left tensed when I sleep
| like a face down in the gravel
| I have to wonder
| after the workday
| I scrub at my hands until they grow old
| I am too young
| for this
| what I didn’t make or take still played out
| plays out
| every fucking day
| fucking federals,
| goddamn fools. Next time kick yourselves out
| cut your own damn faces up
| god doesn’t care, he doesn’t give a fuck
| he’s as tired as the rest of us

*tea/comb:*

| I passed the room where I got my first blow-job
| the day I stopped going to church
| the bathroom I took my first pill
| the rundown church where the holy spirit entered me
| the airport I left for Africa
| the street I first got mugged
| the theater where I lost feeling
| for the first time
| to when I was eight
| and lived on a street with fuschia bushes
| and snail-slicked paths
| and football outside everyday
| and, you know,
| it never would have crossed my mind
| there as an eight year old child
| that I'd ever even make it to 29
| and be a man who stood 6'2 and 300 lbs
| with a shaved head and childish lips
| who lived a mile above sea level and laid naked with women
| and didn't believe in god
| who had felt the pentecost
| believing in magic
| sitting with homeless on iona road
| reading bible verses at them
| whose mind, heavy with stalagtites,
| had, one day, just caved in.
| but then, I suspect,
| that no one ever ends where they expected
| or is not horribly changed
| by the arriving
|
| Some days I walk the 2.4 miles across the bridge,
| along the freeway,
| past the man in a Mad Hatter outfit
| spinning a sign selling BBQ Ribs,
| past 3 bus stops where a woman is stuffing her purse with blank slips of paper,
| just to buy a large coffee from the 7-11.
|
| Some days I get so lonely I forget my own name

*bathtub:*

| I only notice the ripples
| when I am absolutely still

*sex
slow
everything in rhythm to the sex
breathing*

*washing hands*

*Lady GaGa prepares for her death*

| I know that I shall meet my fate
| Somewhere among the clouds above;
| Those that I fight I do not hate,
| Those that I guard I do not love;
| As I speak
| highly civilized human beings are flying overhead,
| trying to kill me.
| They do not feel any enmity against me
| as an individual,
| nor I against them.
| Most of them,
| I have no doubt
| are kind-hearted.
| Law-abiding men
| who would never dream of committing murder
| in private life.
| But
| if one of them succeeds
| he will never sleep any the worse for it.
| He is serving his country.
| He will be absolved from evil.

*and hangs herself
while saying:*

| my hell comes from inside myself. why fight this?
| no one’s gonna play the harp when you die.
| I balanced all, brought all to mind,
| The years to come seemed waste of breath,
| A waste of breath the years behind
| In balance with this life, this death.

*Lady Gaga finds a birthday cake
and lights the candles
and eats some frosting with her finger*

| I'm not fighting because I believe in it
| I'm fighting because I don't know what else to do.

*everyone lights candles
the place becomes holy*

*someone arranging fruit
in neat rows across the entire space:*

| my grandmother survived the war barefoot, scavenging other
| people’s inedibles: rotting potatoes, discarded scraps of meat,
| skins, and the bits that clung to bones.
|
| food is not food. it is terror, dignity, gratitude, vengeance,
| joyfulness, humiliation, religion, history, and, of course
|
| love
|
| terror
|
| sacrifice

*they begin to squash the fruit
beneath their feet*

| animals and humans
| entrails
| guts on canvas
| kisses
| guts on canvas
| kisses
| bowing to the blood
| dissolution of the self/ves
| orpheus torn limb from limb
| a lamb's head floating on a river
| dancing/fucking in the guts of a beast
| as man breathes, so does the universe

*Lady GaGa is about to die*

| what happens when the heart just stops?
| no more to breathe, no more to grieve, coming home
| remember to live before you die

*pause*

| make a wish

*she blows out the candles on her cake*

| what else do I have to do today?

*she jumps from the acropolis
and hangs herself
and is stoned
and dies
face down in the cake*

A CONSPIRACY OF US
------------------

*dark
a sound
followed by sounds from all around
a cappella
as there is light
and everyone moves
one at a time
in single file
across the room
while
jokes are told about suicide and death
they each stop briefly at a wash basin,
dip their hands in  blood
and spread it on their clothes
before crossing to Lady Gaga
and serving each other cake*

*do they offer the audience birthday cake as well?*
