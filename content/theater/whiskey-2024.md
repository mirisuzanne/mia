summary: >
  As a Teacup Gorilla album-release concert
  is overtaken by Denver mythology,
  the bandmates are forced to contend with friendship,
  loss, identity, memory, and a cursed pool that _“makes men soft”_.
---

_What does that mean?
Could it be the hot springs in Ouray,
or the waterfall at Casa Bonita?
And why is there a kiddie pool on stage?_

Live music and Denver lore weave together
in this new hybrid performance,
which is also an album-release
for the latest Teacup Gorilla EP.

This is a love song to our city.
To friendships that last… and friendships that don’t.
A queer and heartfelt reflection on friendship and change --
in a city that's not quite west, but also not exactly midwest.
Something in-between.

Featuring different opening-act special guests every night!
