  in the early days of the pandemic --
  based on a true story of queer joy.

> Rattlesnakes are low to the ground and full of surprises.
> Like hearts, their jaws never give up.
> But do you think rattlesnakes ever get to feel what it's like to fall?

Text taken verbatim from letters, phone messages,
journal entries, and poems
between Julie Rada and Lars Reid
are combined with original dance
(Kate Speer, Allison Blakeney)
and live music (Teacup Gorilla)
to explore blossoming connection in a time of isolation.

Set and costumes are designed and constructed
by Annabel Reader and Dan Huling of the Colorado Shoe School,
and the show is co-produced by Buntport Theater.
