summary: |
  Inspired by Georg Büchner’s unfinished masterpiece, *Woyzeck*,
  [The LIDA Project](/orgs/lida/) reinterprets
  the story of a young soldier
  returning from the horrors of war.
---

Reality bends in the unsteady world of this soldier’s mind
as he grapples with a society in which he no longer belongs.
Originally written in the 1830’s and never finished,
Büchner left modern literature with one of its first anti-heroes.
This is the portrait of an Everyman
who descends into madness and murder.
*The Anonymous Mr. W* brings this story of war and loss
with a vengeance into the post-modern dialogue.
