      It’s theater of chaos.
      It’s smoldering,
      it feels a little dangerous
      and it’s completely unlike any other theatrical experience
      you’ll get in this town.

summary: |
  The citizens are easily roused and swayed,
  as a culture of fear infects the city
  with the constant threat of execution.
---

During the chaos of the Revolution,
a man in isolation has left the political scene
to languish in sensual delights.
Another man at the zenith of power
clings to virtue and a hunger for conformity.

Through the lens of LIDA’s unique aesthetic
and devised through collaborative process,
Georg Büchner’s classic *Danton’s Death*,
gets a new life in this story
of the inevitable triumph of humanity
and its insatiable lust for life --
against the backdrop of sex, violence,
corruption, and bloodshed.
