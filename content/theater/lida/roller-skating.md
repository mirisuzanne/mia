      Roller Skating With My Cousin is a musical
      love letter from the future, on wheels,
      with utter disregard for logic and linearity…
      the 1980s have long been thought of as a time best forgotten…
      Then along came the delightfully whacked-out
      lunatics at the LIDA Project.

      It’s riveting, surprising, a beautiful cross…between theater and life.

summary: |
  Part science lab, part disco,
  *Roller Skating With My Cousin*
  is a lively, dark romp
  in which synchronized roller skaters
  build a tower under a star-flecked mirror ball sky.
---

Combining the biblical Tower of Babel
with the sexual revolutionary act of roller skating --
while asking whether we can create
a custom-designed universe in our kitchen sink and,
furthermore,
why did Ronald Reagan fail as the anti-Christ?
