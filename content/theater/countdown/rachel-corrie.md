summary: |
  Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 – March 16, 2003)
  was an American member of the
  International Solidarity Movement (ISM)
  who traveled to the Gaza Strip
  during the Al-Aqsa Intifada.
  She was killed when she tried to obstruct
  a Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer o
  perated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF.)
---

The circumstances of Corrie’s death are disputed.
Corrie was interfering with an IDF bulldozer
operating in a Palestinian area of Rafah,
close to the border with Egypt –
an area the IDF had designated a security zone
for operations designed to uncover
the network of smuggling tunnels
connecting Egypt to the Palestinian side of Rafah,
used for smuggling weapons from Egypt to the Gaza strip.

The ISM says that the driver of the bulldozer
deliberately ran her over twice
while she was trying to prevent
the demolition of the home of Samir Nasrallah,
a local pharmacist.
The official Israeli Government Report and the IDF deny that,
and state that she was killed by falling debris
pushed over by a bulldozer whose driver did not see her,
and that the bulldozer was clearing brush
and not engaged in a demolition when Corrie impeded on its path.

Corrie’s death sparked controversy
and led to international media coverage,
in part because she was an American,
and in part because of the highly politicized nature
of the conflict itself.
