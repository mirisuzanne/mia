summary: |
  I've worked in professional theater for over 20 years,
  taking on every role available --
  from writing and directing,
  to acting, design, live soundscapes, and electrical work.

After studying theater at
[Goshen College](/education/goshen/)
and interning at the
[Oregon Shakespeare Festival](/education/osf/),
I became the Artistic Director
of [New World Arts](/orgs/new-world-arts/)
from 2001--2006.
Since moving to Denver,
I've worked with a number of ensemble companies,
and started one of my own:
[Grapefruit Lab](/orgs/grapefruit-lab/).
