Hi, I'm here to tell you about Bea Arthur // -ian legend //

Specifically, Season 6, episode 23 --
Night at a Round Table.
Let's meet the proagonist, our hero // Bea Arthur //

Not to be confused with Arthur the anthropomorphic aardvark //
aka anteater //

no relation to the actual four species of suborder vermilingua, the worm tongues //

Bea grew up in the Bronx //
attending the linden school for girls //
while arthur grew up in Elwood City //
and currently attends Lakewood Elementary school //

So season 6, episode 23 --
night of the round table. here we go. //

Brooklyn. Dusk. The sun sets slow on the the city that never sleeps. //
Nearby Elwood City also descends into darkness //
Arthur is in bed, settling in for a night of Bionic Bunny, Special Edition.
Is it 4:30pm? Why is the sun setting so early?
Or is Arthur awake at 4:30am? We'll never know //

Because our story takes in a sunshine state suddenly devoid of sun.
Miami. At Night. //
Now available on Amazon for 24.99 --
only 11 left in stock. //

Bea Arthur, sits at a table. Not just any table. This table is round. //
A round table. Have you ever seen anything like it? //
Yes, yes you have. //
And so has Betty white, now sitting at the table with Bea Arthur.
What hijinx will ensue?! //

Well Bea's like, Pizza Damnit, get pizza!
And this is where everything goes wrong. //

One day you're like: sure, weed should be legal. //
And the next thing you know, Denver is overrun by cortado-drinking //
frat bros with their swords in the air //
and a constant lodo beard-fest
in the background of your once-chill round-table sitcom. //

And now these bros are like: I have an idea --
we should sit at round tables. We came up with that.
It was our idea. //

And they start a round-table society, no girls allowed! //
Where they all wear dumb robes,
and it's like the Freemasons or some goofy shit.
Charlatans that something something something
and make a hubbub in the city! //

Bea Arthur could vomit just looking at them. //

So she gets on the horn with her good friend Angela, //
Writer of murders // And they concoct a plan. //

[// // // black and white]
Now, eagle eyed viewers will notice they've done all of this
at and around several important tables.
Not square tables.
These women are round-table pioneers --
perfectionists of the form. //

Bea even has a round chair to sit in. That's dedication. //

But the men have built this massive table now, and they're all like: //

Look at my sword.
I got it from a stone or a lake-lady or whatever,
and I gave it a name. //
Hey, look at my sword.
I named it Excalibur, and it makes me the king. //
Why won't you look at my sword?
I sent you a picture of my sword,
and it's a big sword. Send nudes. //

I don't care about your sword, Chad. //

Oh, you don't like swords --
well look at my lance.
I have a huge lance.
Do you like my lance?
It's so big. I love it so much they call me — //

Gross. That's gross. //

So our Hero turns to her friends, and is like //
We must be the change we wish to see in the world //
And they all move to the living room, where the table has corners!
They start a rectangle campaign! //
Coffee tables! // Folding tables! //
Buffet tables! // Whatever this is! //

Meanwhile the men are all Purity of Essence!
And Fluoridation in the water!
And their tables get bigger and rounder //
and more religious //
And they're busy comparing sword sizes in the locker room //

while Bea, over in apt. 23, has a plan. //
She was born for a moment like this. //
you can't bea more than she'll be. She is Bea! //
And you're just a wannabe! //
Why is she even talking to you about this? //

Now Lance guy's all butt-hurt about it,
and he charges in with his weapon erect. //
But our Golden Girls aren't scared //
and Bea leads an army of Star Wars Christmas Special aliens
to defeat the creepy secret sword society //
and they construct a memorial in memory of that night!
The night of the round table. Never forget. //

Bea Arthur delivers…
There are other legends too, of course: //
Like when she wins the spelling bee //
and makes an album for kids.
*It's alright to cry.*
I love that song. //

Happy Bea-day. //
