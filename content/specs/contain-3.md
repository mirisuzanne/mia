summary: |
  CSS Containment Level 3
  defines Container Queries
  and container-relative units --
  allowing authors to build more intrinsic
  responsive components
  without knowledge of the overall layout.
---
{% import "content.macros.njk" as content %}
{% import "utility.macros.njk" as utility %}

Media-queries allow an author to make style changes
based on the overall viewport dimensions --
but in many cases,
authors would prefer styling modular components
based on their context and available space within a layout.
Earlier this year,
David Baron & Brian Kardell
proposed two complementary approaches to explore:
a [`@container` rule][dbaron-cq],
and a [`switch()`][switch] function.
Both could be useful in different cases.

[dbaron-cq]: https://github.com/dbaron/container-queries-implementability
[switch]: https://bkardell.com/blog/AllThemSwitches.html

This specification builds on David Baron's `@container` approach,
with a syntax that is similar to media queries.
We also define 'container-relative units' (`cq*`)
that match the existing 'viewport-relative units' (`v*`).

## Resources {id=resources}

{% for item in resources -%}
- {{ utility.link_if(item.title, item.url) }}{% if item.credit %} by _{{ item.credit }}_{% endif %}{% if item.venue %} at **{{ item.venue }}**{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Browser Support

{{ content.caniuse('css-container-queries') }}
