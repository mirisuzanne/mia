[Ersatz Robots](https://ersatzrobots.bandcamp.com) is a band,
and not really a group of robots at all.
In fact, Ersatz Robots is a group of human women who play music.
We have various influences,
including 90s indie rock,
80s alternative,
punk, and emo --
but only the good emo, we promise.

Founded by Galen Nissa Mitchell,
the Robots have come together for a single show
before our fearless leader moves to the midwest.
We're play with Typesetter,
Cheap Perfume,
and Came & Took It --
all together in remembrance of
[Brittany Strummer](https://www.westword.com/music/brittany-strummer-memorial-events-in-denver-with-typesetter-cheap-perfume-11327298).
