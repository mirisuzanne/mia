For a few years,
[Teacup Gorilla](../teacup-gorilla/)
performed & recorded music with
Rachel Eisenstat --
initially as **Iron City**,
and then **Raven Jane**.
While she went on to make the
*Queen City Magnetic* album
with other musicians,
we composed several of the songs as a band,
most notably:

- The Hunted
- Last Bullet (also on our [debut EP](/2015/07/09/holes-they-leave/)
- Charlie's Engine
