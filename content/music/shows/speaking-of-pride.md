## Fragments (lyrics)

We have a story in my family.
My brother is young,
nursing his favorite doll.
He says *I'm going to be a mommy when I grow up!*
Mom is proud but corrects him --
 *boys grow up to be daddies.*

He sets down the doll,
and never picks it back up.
*Cis doesn’t mean simple,*
he tells me now,
a father of two.
I keep my dolls much later in life,
their unexpected aunt.

I never felt like a girl.
What do girls feel like?
I didn’t always know,
and dream of wearing dresses.
I wasn’t consistent, insistent, or persistent.
I was frustrated.

A friend asks me what it means to be a woman.
I have no idea.
What does it mean for you to be your gender?

Hanson is on the radio. \
Why is Hanson on the radio?

If I had a story like that,
maybe everything would make sense.
Maybe I could string this together into a narrative:
beginning, middle, and end.
Life doesn't work that way.

A visiting trans friend asks where I get my Testosterone.
I make it inside my body, I tell him.
I’d give it to you if I could.

Hormones are slow magic.

In my dreams, I’m transgender. \
In the mirror, I’m uncertain. \
In public, I’m a woman.

In Colorado,
your chosen name
has to sue your given name
for the right to exist.

I don’t get to put all the pieces together.
“Passing” is not something I do,
but something that happens to me —
not a way of presenting,
but a way of being seen.
Fickle.
In a single moment I can be seen and not seen,
gendered and misgendered.
Ungendered, and undressed.

I don’t believe in authenticity,
but I do believe in pain,
and doing something to survive it.

Trying on clothes to see if they fit
is way better than trying on clothes to see if your gender fits.
I didn’t know there was a difference,
until everything changed.

I can finally hate my body for the normal reasons.
