## Title

Intrinsic Design
with Container Queries & Units

## Audience & Market

### Who is the primary intended audience?

Professional 'design engineers' --
front end developers who implement designs on the web
using HTML & CSS.

I see this book fitting into several ABA collections:

- Responsive Design (and Starter Kit)
- Design for any Device
- Front End Next Steps

### What secondary audiences might also appreciate this book?

- Web designers who want to understand what capabilities exist

### What are three reasons that readers would buy this book?

- Learn why container queries exist, and when to use them.
- Learn the syntax of container queries & units.
- Understand how container queries fit into a broader
  move towards more intrinsic web design.

### What are some other books on the market that address your topic?

Since container queries are a new feature of CSS,
I was not able to find existing books specifically on the topic.
Similarly, intrinsic web design is a relatively new term,
without any dedicated books.

### How will your book be different?

There are many books on similar or related topics --
such as responsive design,
layout patterns,
and media queries.
This book will place container queries
(and intrinsic web design)
into that existing context,
as an evolution of the responsive design principles
and underlying features.
