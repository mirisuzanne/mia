[Layer tennis](http://layertennis.com/)
is a design game
made popular by
[Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com/).
Two competitors (myself & [Aaron Liechty](http://aaronliechty.tumblr.com/))
pass design files back and forth,
riffing on the same work under extreme time constraints.
Each 30-minute "volley" is posted live as it is created,
along with commentary
thanks to [Jacob Liechty](http://jacobliechty.tumblr.com/).

[Sondra Eisenstat](http://sondraedesign.tumblr.com/)
agreed to help us
with the thankless task of posting it all online,
since the rest of us were pre-occupied
with writing & designing under pressure.

The battle took place on Sunday afternoon.
The full experience is still available
on the [Exit Strata blog][blog],
but here are the volleys:
