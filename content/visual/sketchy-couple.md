I began this portrait in the same manner
as the [Kitten Karlyle][kk] illustration,
and quickly found that it was the wrong style for these two.
I made several more stylistic attempts,
and was unhappy with all of them.
We call that "the creative process".
I finally found the style I wanted
by accidentally viewing all my sketches
layered on top of each other.
The rest was just a matter of cleanup.
