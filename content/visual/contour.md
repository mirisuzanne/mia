The editors at
SpringGun Press asked me
to design cover art
for _The Posture of Contour_,
a new book by
[James Belflower][james].
I used the opportunity to get my mind out of an all-digital space,
and spent most of my time with pen, paper, and oil pastel.

## Sketches

My favorite experiments involved
[blind contours][blind contours] with a capped pen
over homemade (oil-pastel) carbon paper,
then arrows traced on a third layer
using my iPad as a light table.

## Final(ish) Design

In the end,
James decided on the abstract jawbone pattern in red arrows.
