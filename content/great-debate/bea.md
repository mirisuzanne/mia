Bea Arthur

Not to be confused with Arthur the anthropomorphic aardvark

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.005.jpeg)

aka anteater

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.006.jpeg)

or any of the actual
four species of suborder vermilingua,
the worm tongues

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.007.jpeg)

Bea grew up in the Bronx

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.008.jpeg)

attending the linden school for girls

while arthur grew up in Elwood City

and currently attends Lakewood Elementary school

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.011.jpeg)

So season 6, episode 23 --
night of the round table. here we go.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.012.jpeg)

Brooklyn. Dusk. The sun sinks low on the the city that never sleeps.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.013.jpeg)

Nearby Elwood City also descends into darkness

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.014.jpeg)

Arthur is in bed, settling in for a night of Bionic Bunny, Special Edition.
Is it 4:30pm? Why is the sun setting so early?
Or is Arthur awake at 4:30am? We'll never know

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.015.jpeg)

Because our story takes place in a sunshine state
suddenly devoid of sun.
Miami at Night.

Interior. The night is dark.
Bea Arthur, sits at a table. Not just any table. This table is round.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.018.jpeg)

A round table. Have you ever seen anything like it?

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.019.jpeg)

Yes, yes you have.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.020.jpeg)

And so has Betty white, now sitting at the table with Bea Arthur.
What hijinx will ensue?!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.021.jpeg)

Well Bea's like, Pizza Damnit, get pizza!
And this is where everything goes wrong.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.022.jpeg)

One day you're like: sure, weed should be legal.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.023.jpeg)

And the next thing you know, Denver is overrun by cortado-drinking

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.024.jpeg)

frat bros with their swords in the air

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.025.jpeg)

and a constant lodo beard-fest
in the background of your once-chill round-table sitcom.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.026.jpeg)

And now these bros are like:
We already dominate the board room tables,
we should take over the round tables as well!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.027.jpeg)

And they start a round-table society, no girls allowed!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.028.jpeg)

Where they all wear dumb robes,
and it's like the Freemasons or some goofy shit.
Charlatans that something something something
and make a hubbub in the city!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.029.jpeg)

Bea Arthur could vomit just looking at them.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.030.jpeg)

So she gets on the horn with her good friend Angela,

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.031.jpeg)

Writer of murders

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.032.jpeg)

 And they concoct a plan.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.033.jpeg)

Now, eagle eyed viewers will notice they've done all of this

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.034.jpeg)

at and around several important tables.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.035.jpeg)

Not square tables.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.036.jpeg)

These women are round-table pioneers --
perfectionists of the form.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.037.jpeg)

Bea even has a round chair to sit in. That's dedication.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.038.jpeg)

But the men have built this massive table now, and they're all like:

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.039.jpeg)

Look at my sword.
I got it from a stone or a lake-lady or whatever,
and I gave it a name.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.040.jpeg)

Hey, look at my sword.
I named it Excalibur, and it makes me the king.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.041.jpeg)

Why won't you look at my sword?
I sent you a picture of my sword,
and it's a big sword. Send nudes.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.042.jpeg)

Bea has nudes, of course,
but not for you.
She doesn't care about your sword, Chad.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.043.jpeg)

Oh, you don't like swords --
well look at my lance.
I have a huge lance.
Do you like my lance?
It's so big. I love it so much they call me â€”

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.044.jpeg)

Gross. That's gross.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.045.jpeg)

So our Hero turns to her friends, and is like

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.046.jpeg)

We must be the change we wish to see in the world

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.047.jpeg)

And they all move to the living room, where the table has corners!
They start a rectangle campaign!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.048.jpeg)

Coffee tables!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.049.jpeg)

Folding tables!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.050.jpeg)

Buffet tables!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.051.jpeg)

Whatever this is!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.052.jpeg)

Meanwhile the men are all Purity of Essence!
And Fluoridation in the water!
And their tables get bigger and rounder

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.053.jpeg)

and more religious

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.054.jpeg)

And they're busy comparing sword sizes in the locker room

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.055.jpeg)

while Bea, over in apt. 23, has a plan.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.056.jpeg)

She was born for a moment like this.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.057.jpeg)

you can't bea more than she'll be. She is Bea!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.058.jpeg)

And you're just a wannabe!

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.059.jpeg)

Why is she even discussing this with you?

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.060.jpeg)

Now Lance guy's all butt-hurt about it,
and he charges in with his weapon erect.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.061.jpeg)

But our Golden Girls aren't scared

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.062.jpeg)

and Bea leads an army of Star Wars Christmas Special aliens
to defeat the creepy secret sword society

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.063.jpeg)

and they construct a memorial in memory of that night!
*The night of the round table*. Never forget.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.064.jpeg)

Bea Arthur delivers!

There are other legends too, of course...

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.065.jpeg)

Like when she wins the spelling bee

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.066.jpeg)

and makes an album for kids.
*It's alright to cry.*
I love that song.

![](/assets/images/debate/bea/bea.067.jpeg)

Happy Bea-day.
