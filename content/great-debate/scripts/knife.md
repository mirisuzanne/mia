Did you know the Swiss have an army?
I kinda thought they didn't,
which would be cool.
But they do,
it's just really small
and frankly
(thanks to Victorinox & Wenger):
_well-prepared_.

Yeah, there's two companies involved here --
or there were.
Victorinox made the first model for the Swiss Army,
later splitting the contract with Wenger,
and eventually buying them out.

There have been 5 primary models
of the _soldier knife_ --
let's please try to be specific with our language here --
since it was first issued in 1891.
And still today,
they're considered _essential for survival_ --
issued to every recruit or member
of the Swiss Army.

You can use one of these
practical suckers
to cut, saw, open, strip, punch, and screw
to your hearts delight.
And it all fits on a keychain!

The American colloquial term 'Swiss Army Knife'
was coined by soldiers in World War Two,
out of admiration for these handy devices --
and now refers to basically any penknife
with more than a single blade,
as long as you put a little red cross on it.

And clearly Victorinox & Wenger both
have a great sense of humor about this --
making a wide variety of
action-packed penknife multitools,
like the one with a thumb drive and laser pointer,
several with butane lighters,
or barometers and alarm clocks,
and then this 'champ',
and the world-record-holding Giant.

But this isn't an episode of Survivor!
It's some weird mashup cross-over where
_MacGyver-does-Tool Time_ meets
_Shark-Week, Naked and Afraid_.

MacGyver loves these things,
and always has.
There are websites dedicated
to all the different Victorinox
models used in every episode of the show.

You know what show I like?

But let's talk about this 'debate'
for a bit.

Octopus vs Swiss Army Knife.

Both are pretty cool,
but you're only gonna take one of them along
when you go camping.

Ok, let's approach this logically.
Just the facts, please, everyone.

An octopus has 8 limbs.
An octopus with a Swiss Army Knife
has eight tools to choose from.
An octopus with eight Swiss Army Knives
has a eight tools _per limb_.
Each limb is basically sentient,
and now --
thanks to Victorinox & Werner --
each limb is _prepared_!

What's better than an octopus?
A prepared octopus!

You might think it's hard to compare a tool,
with the person using the tool?
I mean, don't you need both?
Sure you do!
I get that.
I have nothing against an octopus --
unless it's complicit in
some sketchy fortune-telling scam.
Hashtag not all octopy, I know.
But we can still ask --
who's bringing more to the equation?
That's easy to answer.

Does the octopus make the knife better?
Not really.
It's still the same knife,
being used as intended.

Does the knife make the octopus better?
Oh hell yeah,
check this guy out.

Does the Swiss Army
issue one of these knives
to every recruit or member of the
Swiss Armed Forces?
Hell yeah.

Does the Swiss Army
issue anyone an octopus?
Nope.
An octopus is not considered
'essential for survival'.

An octopus isn't even allowed to join the Swiss Army!
