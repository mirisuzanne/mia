summary: |
  I was invited to join the CSS Working Group
  to help develop the next level of
  Cascading & Inheritance --
  along with Container Queries,
  CSS scoping, and more.
---

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the design language of the web --
allowing authors and users to attach style
(fonts, spacing, filter effects, style animations, and more)
to structured documents and Web applications.
By separating the presentation style from the content,
CSS simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance.

All my research, explainers, and proposals
are available at [css.oddbird.net](https://css.oddbird.net/)
