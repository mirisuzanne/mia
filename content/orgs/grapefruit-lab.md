## A Performance Laboratory

Julie, Kenny, and Miriam have been working together since 2007,
under a range of different names and companies --
most notably Vicious Trap,
a catch-all moniker for our various interests.

Grapefruit Lab is the new combined vision
and multimedia intersection of our work.
Grapefruit Labâ€™s name
encapsulates our goal of combining highly-aesthetic,
compelling artistic work embeded in our communities.

We want to make art without assumptions --
art that humanizes
and entertains
and challenges
and brings you into conversation.
