summary: |
  Grapefruit is a hybrid of lemon and orange.
  Snow is hybrid of wish and lament.

Julie, Kenny, and Miriam have been working together since 2007,
under a range of different names and companies --
most notably Vicious Trap,
a catch-all moniker for our various interests.

Grapefruit Lab is the combined vision
and multimedia intersection of our work.
We want to make art without assumptions --
art that humanizes
and entertains
and challenges
and brings people into conversation.
