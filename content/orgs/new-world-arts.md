summary: |
  Founded in 1998 as New World Players,
  we produced original & alternative ensemble theater
  for over a decade --
  along with an art gallery and event space.

I began working with New World
as an Assistant Director and Lighting Designer in 2001,
took over Technical Direction,
and eventually became the Artistic Director
from 2003--2007.

Our shows included a mix of
original devised work,
local playwrights,
re-invented classics,
and more.
