summary: |
  For a few years,
  [Teacup Gorilla](../teacup-gorilla/)
  performed & recorded music with
  Rachel Eisenstat --
  initially as **Iron City**,
  and later as **Raven Jane**.
---

Rachelâ€™s powerful vocals
combine her Appalachian roots
with a hard-rocking force.
Mixed with the indie,
post-rock-inspired experimentations of the band,
they create a layered sound
that aims for the gut and head.
