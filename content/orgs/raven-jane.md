summary: |
  Rachelâ€™s powerful vocals
  combine her Appalachian roots
  with a hard-rocking force.
  Mixed with the indie,
  post-rock-inspired experimentations of the band,
  they create a layered sound
  that aims for the gut and head.

For a few years,
[Teacup Gorilla](../teacup-gorilla/)
played various backing roles
for Rachel Eisenstat --
initially known as **Iron City**,
and then **Raven Jane**.
While she went on to make the
*Queen City Magnetic* album
with other musicians,
we composed several of the songs as a band,
most notably:

- The Hunted
- Last Bullet (also on our [debut EP](/2015/07/09/holes-they-leave/)
- Charlie's Engine
