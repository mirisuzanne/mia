      Working with OddBird
      was the best outsourcing experience I’ve ever had.
      OddBird became an extension of our team.

      Other developers build exactly what you say,
      or they don’t understand,
      and develop the wrong thing.
      OddBird always thinks about the project goals.
      I defer to the team expertise now,
      which makes a better result.

      OddBird is high-caliber and nimble.
      Innovative at heart.
      Together, we fundamentally transformed
      the Chicago public school system.

      Since OddBird thinks about handoff from the beginning,
      maintenance has been super easy.
      For example, 100% unit test coverage was a given.
      I never had to ask for it.

summary: |
  I co-founded [OddBird](https://oddbird.net)
  with my brothers in 2008
  to create scalable,
  accessible,
  and performant web applications
  with a human-centered design.
