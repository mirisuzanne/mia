      Teacup Gorilla's amiable creative approach,
      unorthodox roots, and sense of community
      have resulted in a sound that is difficult to pin down:
      part instrumental rock, part glam, part psychedelic, part jazz-inflected.
      And it sounds like nothing much else in this highly imitative era.

summary: |
  Teacup Gorilla inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
  with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry --
  often compared to early Modest Mouse,
  Explosions in the Sky,
  or the Velvet Underground.
