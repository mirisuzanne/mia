> We often use “experimental” in art and design
> to talk about things that are strange or new,
> but experimental process is a well-defined set of steps
> based on scientific method,
> and it’s iterative by nature.
> It would be a stretch to say I use the scientific method directly,
> but the structures translate pretty well for creative work,
> and I use roughly the same techniques
> in theatre, writing, design, or music.
