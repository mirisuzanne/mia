I did a [live Q&A at SitePoint][qa]
talking about:

- Customizing Susy for your projects
- Other ways to do layouts (and why you might not even need a toolkit)
- How to select a toolkit, or build your very own!

> To be clear:
> now that we have border-box sizing,
> grid math can be much simpler.
> Complex math is only required
> if you are using margin-based gutters.
> Move your gutters into padding,
> and the math is simple.
> That's why I don't use Susy
> (or any grid system)
> much any more.
> `percentage(1/5)` works great in Sass -
> and flexbox takes care of the rest.
