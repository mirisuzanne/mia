> Riding SideSaddle* is not like most things you’ve read.
> On the surface it startles with its three-dimensionality —
> it’s not a spinebound book but a deck of cards,
> and you shuffle it before each reading.
> It’s a new, and wonderful, adventure each time,
> a story of outcasts, their caretaker,
> and the friendship and love they find with each other.
> It’s a story about the body and hybridity —
> based on the myth of Hermaphroditus —
> and it’s a story about magic and the slipperiness of categories.
