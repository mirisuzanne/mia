> Multi-talented as an artist, actor, designer and musician,
> Miriam Suzanne has roots in Brian Freeland’s LIDA Project,
> which brought an era of bracing experimental theater to Denver
> before Freeland moved to New York four years ago.
> But she’s also gone solo over the years
> with theatrical colleagues Julie Rada and Kenny Storms,
> most currently working under the title of Grapefruit Lab,
> while also performing with the band Teacup Gorilla
> and creating Riding Sidesaddle*,
> a morphing book project composed on interchangeable index cards.
> As Grapefruit Lab prepares to premiere its first effort,
> **JANE/EYRE**,
> we invited Suzanne to speak up via the 100CC questionnaire.
