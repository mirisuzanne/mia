Check out the new *Design Better* book --
written by Natalya Shelburne, Adekunle Oduye, Kim Williams, and Eddie Lou --
including video interviews with myself and others.

I'm a fan of all these authors,
and excited to read the whole book.
They also include [interviews][] with
Ire Aderinokun, Brenda Storer, Stephanie Rewis,
Anna Vu, and Matt Rothenberg.

The full book is available free
as a website, epub, PDF, or audiobook.
I talked to them about pairing designers with developers,
and finding the right levels of fidelity for a mockup
depending on the situation:
