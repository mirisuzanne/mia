    A scene wipe transition in Star Wars,
    as Luke and C-3PO in a speeder
    wipe across a close-up
    of Luke and Obi-Wan talking.
    Over top, a dotted line shows the transition edge,
    and a red arrow shows the transition movement
    in front of the speeder.

summary: |
  There’s a new web API proposal
  for transitioning shared-elements across pages.
  It’s great for making smooth page transitions,
  but what if we apply it to individual elements
  with changing styles on a single page?
