    Caution, slip hazard,
    with stick figure falling backwards.
summary: |
  There's a well-established 'best practice'
  that CSS authors
  (as well as linters and minifiers)
  should remove units from any `0` value.
  It's a fine rule in most cases,
  but there are a few common situations
  where it will break your code.
