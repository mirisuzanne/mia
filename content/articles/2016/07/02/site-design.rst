Re-design without a deadline
============================

It is past time for a re-design of my site,
but there's a lot here,
and I don't have the time
to get all the details just the way I want them.

Instead,
I've moved some pieces around,
updated my dependencies,
and added just enough style to point in a new direction.

It's not perfect,
but it's a place to start.
The rest can happen slowly.
