  I did a `live Q&A at SitePoint`_
  talking about:

  - Customizing Susy for your projects
  - Other ways to do layouts (and why you might not even need a toolkit)
  - How to select a toolkit, or build your very own!

SitePoint: Live Q&A on Toolkits
===============================

I did a `live Q&A at SitePoint`_
talking about:

- Customizing Susy for your projects
- Other ways to do layouts (and why you might not even need a toolkit)
- How to select a toolkit, or build your very own!

  To be clear:
  now that we have border-box sizing,
  grid math can be much simpler.
  Complex math is only required
  if you are using margin-based gutters.
  Move your gutters into padding,
  and the math is simple.
  That's why I don't use Susy
  (or any grid system)
  much any more.
  `percentage(1/5)` works great in Sass -
  and flexbox takes care of the rest.

as well â€”
but it leaves out some good bits. ;)
