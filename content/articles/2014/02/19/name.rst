Goodbye, Abram
==============

In 2005, `my brother`_
got me hooked on `CSS`_ (the language of web design)
by showing me
`Eric A Meyer`_â€™s `css-edge`_ experiments.
I bought Eric's `book`_ on ebay,
had a good laugh at our identical names,
and started building websites.
Now the confusion between us has gotten out of hand
(despite his patience and good humor).

He was here first,
and has a `solid hold`_ on the name.
It's past time for me to make a change.
As a first step,
let me introduce my new middle name:

*Eric Suzanne Meyer*. [`see update </2014/02/26/name/>`_]

Suzanne is the middle name I would have had at birth
under different genital circumstances,
passed down in variations
from my mother (Brenda Sue),
grandmother (Marian Susanna),
great-great-grandmother (Susanna Brendle),
the co-protagonist of my `novel`_,
and some `software`_ I named after her.
