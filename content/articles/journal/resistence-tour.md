summary: |
  It's been a month
  since our country pseudo-elected
  a bigoted blow-hard for president.
  I'm heading to DC to protest his inauguration in January,
  visit friends,
  and go on a mixed-media resistance tour...

I'll be:

- reading from my queer-as-fuck novel [Riding SideSaddle*][sidesaddle],
  while being a loud and vocal trans woman.
- speaking about empathy
  in art and code and software.
- chatting about queer identities,
  hate, politics, and intersectionality.
- hugging people.

I'm not changing the world here,
[there's more to do][todo],
but it feels like a nice way to get started,
find my energy,
and find my people.

Any profits will go to
[one of these rad organizations](https://togetherlist.com/)
committed to empowering
women, people of color, immigrants, queers, Muslims, and disabled people â€”
or fighting climate change.
If you have a specific organization to recommend,
[I'm all ears](/contact/).
