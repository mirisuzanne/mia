    Right foot inside has lavender low-top with blue lining
    that transitions to silver/black stripes and orange upper.
    Left foot outside is magenta with yellow lace panel.
    Both have a mix of tan stitched art,
    black stitched horizontal lines,
    and red stitched scribbles.

      with Colorado Shoe School painted on the door
      and a massive metal boot mounted on the cab.
      Immediately behind that,
      a fence of stacked wood with ends showing,
      and Erin standing behind a small metal gate under a tree.

      a fire circle,
      a log with a rocking-chair back,
      a house to one side,
      open yard, trees,
      and stacked wood fence.

      scattered with leather and fabric scraps,
      scissors, and straight pins.
      In the middle cut-out parts for one shoe --
      magenta high-top outer,
      with a floral fabric lacing panel,
      back-to-back with a
      cyan low-top inner with orange high-top upper,
      and the same floral panel,
      then a gold leather toe-cap.

      Top shoe has yellow high-top outer,
      and lavender low-top inner,
      with orange high-top addition.
      Bottom shoe has magenta high-top outer,

      two nested gold toe-caps sewn to rose gold tongues,
      and a magenta high-top side panel
      with a sketchy one-line stitched moth (wings spread),
      and an awl for picking out remnants of stitched-in paper.

      On a sewing machine,
      the yellow high-top is sewn at the heal
      to a lavender low-top and orange addition.
      The yellow side has stitching of two moths,
      and some straight black lines across,
      with orange lacing panels.
      The lavender side has a blue trim
      and then silver-and-black stripes protruding
      up and forward into the orange addition.

      but still without laces.
      The back of the tongue is sparkly black,
      with a pink stitched scribble.
      The inner lining is maroon leather.

summary: |
  Erin and I spent a couple days last week
  at the [Colorado Shoe School](https://coloradoshoeschool.com/)
  in Bellvue, CO --
  learning, designing, and making our own sneakers.
  Yes,
  actual sneakers,
  fit for wearing,
  and built from scratch.
  Only the soles come pre-formed
  out of recycled plastic.

## The Shoe School

Annabel Reader and Dan Huling
are wonderful artists with a background in performance,
and started the shoe school
out of their back yard.
'Back yard' is entirely underselling
the magic they've created on their property.
We stayed in the tiny home
they converted from a 1940s train car,
between the two days of our workshop.

the school and the converted train car.

They have several workshops available,
but we went with the two-day option --
making 'Chuck Taylor' style sneakers.

## Day 1: Design

Day 1 was entirely dedicated to design.
We spent the morning
pulling out rolls of up-cycled leather and fabric
to see what's available,
and sketching ideas on patterns they provided.
Since we were the only two students,
we each got a teacher to ourselves --
Erin working with Dan,
while I worked with Annabel.

Erin had done the workshop before,
and came prepared with some fabric from home.
I was starting from scratch
(with almost no sewing experience),
and didn't really have any idea
what I wanted to make.
Eventually Erin suggested I work from
some of my [_Riding SideSaddle*_ art](/books/sidesaddle/art/),
and Annabel helped guide me through translating
from digital collage into shoe leather.

By the end of day 1
I had selected and cut out
an assortment of bright, saturated leather
for the sides,
and gold leather toe caps.
I still wasn't sure about the design details,
but my main concept involved
using the high-top pattern for the outsides,
and creating a shoe-within-a-shoe effect
on the inside --
with high-top uppers
stitched onto a low-top base.

At this point
it doesn't look like much
(besides a lot of bright fabric),
and I think both Annabel and I
were worried about how it would come together.

I guess I'm making clown shoes?

## Day 2: Construction

Annabel and I both came into day two
with _ideas_ that had been brewing over night.
We agreed that the floral fabric
wasn't matching the other ideas,
and she re-cut my lacing panels from leather,
while I began experimenting
with how to stitch the designs.

It's clear that they have a strong sense of _timing_,
and will jump in to help with repetitive tasks
when you start to fall behind.
It's also clear at this point I was falling behind.
Once I picked out leather for my tongues,
Annabel built the entire toe-and-tongue parts for me.

We had experimented on day 1 with
sewing scraps of fabric
to create the collage effect of my art,
but I decided to simplify:
using various colors of thread
to get different stitched effects --
sketched moths, hard lines, and scribbles.
We found that it worked well
to tack down my drawings onto the leather,
and sew straight through the paper.

  day_two,

It was surprising to me --
despite experiencing the same
in other mediums --
how much things come together
in the last few steps,
and the last hours of the day.
What seemed like a random scattering of bright colors,
came together into _actual shoes_
I could see myself wearing.
Shoes I've been wearing daily for a week now.

We used bike inner tubes
to cover the heal seem,
and provide a heal pull.

All that's left to do is try them on.

and some closeups on the ride home.

## A little more

During the two-days of the workshop,
I got my tan stitched moths,
black stitched perpendicular lines,
and red stitched scribbles.
All that's missing are a bunch of tiny errors!

When I got home,
I ran some tests
with red & black fine-tip sharpies
on scraps of leather.
Only the black is consistently visible,
so I went with it.

{{ content.figure(test) }}

Now I've been wearing the shoes for a week,
and I love them.
I'm on the road this week,
exploring southwest Colorado,
but ere are some more closeups I took
in the hotel room:
