summary: |
  There's a lot of language that gets thrown around,
  but much of it comes loaded with
  over-simplified baggage and misconceptions.
  Here are a few that have been on my mind –
  from *gender identity* to *biological sex*,
  *transition*, *passing*, and *visibility*.

## Gender "Identity"

Identity comes up regularly in trans politics,
but refers to two very
==different concepts== —
often interchangeably,
and without distinction.

1.  Our {{ content.erase('conscious acts') }}
    of identifying with a gender or sexuality —
    male, female, non-binary, fluid, straight, bi, gay, cis, trans,
    ==non-conforming,== or otherwise.
    We all have ==multiple conscious identities,==
    that intersect and change over time.

    Those identities are curated, public, and often fluid.
    I'm still learning to identify as a woman, trans, and lesbian —
    even while the realities are more complex, queer, and fluctuating.
    I also identify as an author, a web developer,
    bi/pansexual, genderqueer, and polyamorous.
    ==None of this is unique to the trans experience.==

2.  Our vague and ==often-elusive== sense of innate gender —
    something most people seem to have,
    but trans people spend more time dealing with.
    [Subconscious sex](http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#subconscioussex)
    is really a better term for understanding trans identities.
    This is not a conscious or curated self-labeling,
    but more like the sensation of being angry ==because you are hungry== —
    a feeling that can be
    ==difficult to pin down==.
    For some it is simply *male* or *female*,
    and becomes obvious early on —
    but for most of us it is more complex,
    and takes years to dig through ==the rubble of== assumptions,
    fears, and prejudices around ==our bodies==.

    Cis people also have subconscious gender identities,
    though it's more easy to assume that your sex is completely
    [constructed](http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#genderartifactualism)
    or [flows seamlessly](http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#genderdeterminism)
    from your genitalia
    when it has never been ==called into question==.

## "Biological" Sex

Many people distinguish "gender identity"
(*between the ears*)
from "biological sex"
(*between the legs*) —
as though one is natural and static,
while the other is invented or fluid.
That's a vast oversimplification of the science,
and ==a dangerous== false dichotomy.
Our identities don't exist outside of ==biology==,
and sex ==is== not ==fixed== concept
outside our identities.
These two ideas are inseparable.

When a doctor assigns our gender ==at birth==,
they base the assignment
==on our genitalia alone.==
For the many people born with "ambiguous" genitalia,
it's common practice for doctors to perform surgery —
assigning their "biological sex" by force.
There were never two discrete categories to begin with.

When we try to ==talk about sex== as a reproductive distinction, we're
really talking about internal gonads producing eggs or sperm: testis and
ovary. Reproductive gonads often align with genitals, but not always,
and not in any simple binary. Some people are infertile, some past
menopause, or vasectomies, or other common reproductive changes — making
it clear that gonads don't directly correlate with what we call
"biological" ==sex==.

When we're in public no one knows what genitals or gonads exist *between
our legs*, but they feel comfortable assigning our ==sex== anyway — based
on the assumptions *between their own ears*. Social gendering relies
mainly on "secondary ==sex== characteristics" (especially
masculine-associated facial hair etc) and gender presentation. Our lived
==sex== — the way we are perceived and treated by others — has nothing to
do ==with genitals== or gonads.

Organizations like the
[International Olympic Committee](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/the-humiliating-practice-of-sex-testing-female-athletes.html)
have gone further,
attempting to find a definable "biological sex" in
[chromosomes](http://www.vox.com/2014/6/3/5776396/why-theyre-not-really-sex-chromosomes)
and hormone levels.
The results are the same wherever you look:
our biology ==is a complicated== mix
of genetic inclinations that interact with our ==experiences==
in complex ways over time.

Biology is fluid, identity is biological,
and the male/female binary is
==more social than scientific.==

## "Transition"

Some trans people ==decide to change== how we present to the world. We
transition our public personas, hoping to bring our social lives and/or
bodies more in line with our subconscious sex.

That means different things for different people, but "transition" is
not a surgery, transgender is not a medical term, not ==all trans people==
transition, and we're not all simply men or women *in the wrong body*
moving from one binary to another. Transition is a million little
things, ==for a million different== reasons.

Some of us change our pronouns, or our names — either informally, or
through legal channels. Some take hormones and/or hormone-blockers, a
few get "top" ==surgeries== to augment or remove breast tissue,
==and even fewer== opt for genital surgery,
tracheal shaves, and cosmetic interventions.

"After" transition (which has no real start or finish) we ==are the same==
person that we were before. With or without surgery, our genders are
just as real. Transition does not complete us or make us "real" men and
women. My body was already female, because I was. How and when and why
we transition is more personal and complex than simple ==assimilation==
into cis society.

In October 2015, I decided to start a more intentional transition —
first socially, and then medically. I don't believe in a "true" self
that was hidden before, or in ==vague concepts of authenticity==, or
finally becoming whole. I wasn't born male, I was never a woman ==trapped
in a man's== body, I'm not finally complete, I was never broken, and I
will never be fixed.

People regularly assume that my transition has or will soon involve
==genital surgery==. Maybe. Maybe not. But transition was never about my
genitals. Women are not vaginas, and men are not penises. I won't
finally be a woman if I have surgery, or let a man ==penetrate me.== I'm
not a new or different person, and there really was no chasm to cross
over. My gender and orientation have not changed — only my social
presentation and hormone levels.

I am not finally a woman, but you are finally aware of my womanhood.

## "Passing"

Now that ==strangers== correctly identify me as a woman, people say that I
am "passing" as a woman. They're wrong.

The language of passing is borrowed from racial politics (people of
color passing as white) and later gay/lesbian politics (femme lesbians
==or butch gays== passing as straight), where "passing" means your
marginalized identity is not seen.

Passing is a complicated privilege —  making it possible for
marginalized people to avoid harassment and violence, at the cost of
rejecting or hiding our marginal identities.

It's also complicated because passing is *done to us*.
==In a single moment,==
different people will come to different conclusions about me,
leaving me in a state of Schroedinger's gender.
My "passing" is based on other people's assumptions
about my history.

But passing language is particularly strange for trans people,
who are said to be "passing" when we are identified *correctly*,
in our appropriate genders.
This plays into the popular notion
that our gender is a costume we put on,
and "passing" ==is the entire point of transition —==
the only way to be trans.
People regularly try to help out
by giving us unsolicited advice on our looks,
voices, or movements —
assuming that's what we mean by *transition*.

There's a ==history== to that idea,
[enforced by the medical community](http://www.pqmonthly.com/gatekeeping-the-dark-history-of-trans-health-care/22368)
since the 60's when hormone replacement therapy
started to become a medically-accepted treatment.
Doctors established themselves as gender gatekeepers,
determining who could transition medically —
in part by ==enforcing strict== binary stereotypes.
Until recently, medical transition was only available
if doctors thought you could "pass" well,
and you promised to live ==straight and stealth== after transition.
The goal of "passing" was forced on us,
and made ==trans communities== invisible.

It might be more accurate to say
that I "pass" as cis-gender at times,
or that I previously learned to "pass"
(==well enough==) as man.
Trans people face a real and constant threat of violence,
so blending in as cis can save our lives.
It's hard to constantly have your gender
==called into question,==
or made the center of conversation.
Still, "passing" is not a goal we otherwise share.

## Trans "Visibility"

In the last few years, everyone is talking about trans visibility. Chaz
Bono danced with the stars, suddenly ==Lavern Cox== is everywhere, Caitlin
Jenner made transition a reality TV experience, and now *you're reading
my blog*.

New media comes out every year highlighting trans characters — but most
of them are written, directed, and acted by straight white men,
reinforcing stereotypes more than ==reality==. When a new show or movie
comes out, we're often more scared than excited.

These stories tend to focus on "men who think they are women" and love
doing their makeup more than anything else. After transition they are
either ==beautiful== straight women who get the boy (making them finally
"real" women), or pathetic creatures who *need more help passing* to be
"successfully" trans.

Even the ==true stories== are limited to rich and beautiful women who fit
easily into our existing binary categories: men and women, *just like
you*. Those stories are important, but they aren't the whole picture.
That's not
[how we all do trans](http://www.mtv.com/news/1962946/gender-non-conforming-identity-trans/).

Where are the [gender outlaws](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-bornstein-queer-icon-reflects-on-queer-and-trans-identity-in-2015_us_561823aae4b0e66ad4c7ff37), the fluid identities, ==the femme boys
and butch women== who have always faced the brunt of harassment? Where
are the trans people who are complex and confused, or happy to mix up
our [notions of gender](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-sci)?
When we ==argue for== bathroom rights
based only on ==our ability== to conform,
we're throwing ==our own community== under the bus.

This narrow visibility has been a mixed bag for the trans community.
More of us are coming out, and we're doing it more publicly. For a
minority that's been forced into "stealth" invisibility, it's wonderful
to see (some of) us moving into the light. There's power in numbers.

But the [backlash has been swift and deadly](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/transgender-rights-backlash-anti-lgbt-legislation) — moving ==faster than==
our cultural gains. Trans women (and especially women of color) were
already being killed at unprecedented rates — and those numbers are
higher than ever. We've been using bathrooms since the invention of the
toilet, but suddenly states are passing laws to mandate our bowel
movements, or protect housing and job discrimination (a more basic
concern for many trans people) as ==religious freedoms.==

I was much more visibly ==queer== a year ago. In some ways my transition
has made me safer, by making me one more white woman on the street. All
my femme interests or traits that used to make me ==queer== now make me
invisible. It's easy for me to disappear into this over-simplified
binary trans identity that doesn't really reflect my experience. I want
to be a proud gender-bending ==dyke==, but that's often used as ==proof==
that I'm *really a man*, not [trans enough](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mia-violet/yes-youre-trans-enough-to_b_9318754.html), or in need of
==gender-assimilating== guidance.

Just because some of us are in the ==spotlight== doesn't mean we're all
being seen.

## Just Like (Not) You

Across the board, marginalized groups face a complex problem often
referred to as *respectability politics*. The quickest way into the
mainstream is conformity — but what are the costs, and who is left
behind? Many rights-movements have devolved into "just like you" or
"[born this way](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730310-100-sexuality-is-fluid-its-time-to-get-past-born-this-way/)"
rhetoric, allowing those of us who "pass" in the mainstream to go about
our lives as long as we're willing to blend in.

For a few of us, that's great — or ==at least good enough== — but it's not
the whole story, and it's not the end of our movement. I don't want to
get married, and use gendered toilets like any "normal" cis straight
person — I actually want these ==systems to break down,== and conform
better *to us*. No matter how well my looks or identity fit the popular
trans mythology, I want to ==fight for something== more fluid and open,
that helps the whole world be more ==queer.==

I am a ==woman,== and I am not just like all cis ==women.== I will continue
to fight both sides of that argument, until all my friends have the
==right to live all our identities== in the ways we see fit: monogamous or
polyamorous; straight or bi, pan or gay; sex workers, ==sluts,== and
prudes; trans-binary, ==gender-fluid, butch and femme;== black, brown,
immigrant, Muslim, and interracial; asexual, intersex, ==closeted, and
queer.==

We can't keep accepting identities one-at-a-time, based on their ability
to assimilate with established (straight white cis) norms. We have to
==rebuild these systems== with new, more fluid and queer assumptions.
