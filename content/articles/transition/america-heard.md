summary: |
  My friend [Maureen Maloney][mm] asked to document
  my reaction to the 2016 election,
  as part of the [America Heard][ah] film series.
  Working with Dana Forsberg and Katie Cook,
  we put together this short documentary â€”
  talking about trans rights,
  and completing one step of my legal name change.
  Thanks to [Teacup Gorilla](http://teacupgorilla.com/) and Erin Rollman
  for joining in the fun!
