I’ve been told that you can’t teach creativity, but I disagree.
We think of creativity as sudden, sexy, inexplicable moments of inspiration —
ignoring the hard work that makes those moments possible.


## The Art of Control

Taking control of your art isn’t a matter of brute force. You have to
let go, explore, take risks, and throw yourself off-balance. A good
process will give you that freedom, while nudging you in the right
direction.

- **Ease the burden of originality.** The pressure to be unique and
  interesting can paralyze you. Don’t try to be interesting. Set up
  the conditions, and make sure you capture the results.
- **Do the unthinkable.** The only way to create something beyond
  imagining is to explore outside your own imagination. Let the
  process take you there.
- **Make informed decisions.** Stepping back from the work allows you
  to see it more clearly. Once you have all the options in front of
  you, you can see what works and what doesn’t.
- **Put your strengths (and weaknesses) to use.** Measure your skills
  against each step of the process. Learn what you can count on, where
  you need training or practice, and how to turn your flaws into
  assets along the way.


## Class Overview

I break the creative process down into five major steps. We’ll look at
each one in it’s own post:

1.  Define the Seed: *What’s the idea, question, or hypothesis?*
2.  Explore: *Reasearch, gather, and create the materials.*
3.  Organize: *Outline the structure, or impose one.*
4.  Draft: *Compile a complete first draft.*
5.  Revise: *Consider, critique, and edit as needed.*

There’s more than one way to skin the walrus, and each project will call
for unique adjustments, but the same basic tools are needed to create
genre fiction, absurdest drama, lyric poetry, or conceptual installation
art.

This isn’t paint-by-numbers — it’s a toolkit and a way of thinking. What
you do with it is up to you.
