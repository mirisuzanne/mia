You can't start working
until you know what you are working towards.
That doesn't mean knowing all the answers,
it means knowing the questions that will guide you.

I refer to those guiding questions as
the "seed" of a project.

## A Range of Specimen

{{ content.figure(
  data=specimen,
  caption='what do we have against these cute little insects?'
) }}

There are many ways to find,
define, and refine your seed.
[The LIDA Project][lida]
borrows from [Scientific Method][sci],
starting with a question and related hypothesis.

[lida]: http://lida.org/
[sci]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method

1. Formulate a *question*
2. Do *background research*
3. Construct a *hypothesis*

{{ content.figure(
  data=circle,
  caption="Simon Sinek's *golden circle*"
) }}

[Simon Sinek][sinek] starts his projects with
"why" then "how" and finally "what" -
statements of belief, values, and finally product.

[sinek]: http://startwithwhy.com/

[Anne Bogart][bogart] covers similar territory
with her three-part seed:

[bogart]: http://www.siti.org/

1. What is the *question* that motivates the piece?
2. Who or what is the *anchor* through which we explore the question?
3. What is the *structure* of our exploration?

These are all variations on finding a seed.
It doesn't have to be a formal process,
but it helps to know more-or-less what you need
in order to move forward.

My seeds usually start with a single idea
floating around in my mind
until other ideas attach themselves.
Once the parts begin to gel,
I know it's time to pay closer attention.
In the end,
I have a list similar to Anne's
before I move to the next step.

## A Seed of My Own

One of my current projects-in-development
started with a quote I found on the internet:

> We name and speak of a troublesome ‘transsexualism,’
> the feeling of being the other sex…
> We do not name and talk much about the feeling of being the same sex —
> the sex we think we are, the sex most of us desire to stay.
> But does not our feeling relatively comfortable with our sex,
> and our intense desire to maintain the integrity of our sex,
> indicate something that needs to be explained?
>
> ---Jonathan Ned Katz, [The Invention of Heterosexuality][hetero]

{{ content.figure(
  data=science,
  caption='Out-of-body studies are super weird, yall'
) }}

I combined that with an article
describing the [science of out-of-body experience][body].
It raised some questions for me:

[body]: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=real-outof-body-experiences

- How do we relate to these bodies we live in?
- What does it mean to identify with a body, let alone a sex or gender?
- How are trauma and memory involved?

Those *questions* became the motivating "*why*" of the project.
With a little *background research*
(I used [Wikipedia][wiki], Google, and [my local bookstore][tattered]),
the other pieces fell into place.

{{ content.figure(
  data=herm,
  caption='a herm (named for Hermes) is a statue with carved genitals on un-carved block legs'
) }}

The fragmented & unreliable nature of memory inspired a *structure*:
note cards, each written as a fragment of memory,
and then shuffled before reading.

The *anchor* is a mashup of several existing characters and places
taken from history, mythology and song:
The transformation of [Hermaphroditus][herm],
[Mother Clap][molly]'s 18th-century [Molly Houses][house],
and the songs of Tom Waits & Lou Reed.

[house]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_house

## DI*yourself*

The goal isn't to do it exactly the way I do it,
or the way LIDA, Anne Bogart, or Simon Sinek do it.
The goal is to know what you need,
and then pay attention to how you get there.

De-mystify the process,
then learn to repeat it.
