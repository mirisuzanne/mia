title: F*CSS

  In the CSS naming-convention arms race to lowest specificity,
  I’ve decided to only use universal `*` selectors.
  I call it **F*CSS**.

- It's a recursive backronym: the "F" is for F*CSS
- When asked "why?" you must say "for F*CSS sake" [^1]

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 1em auto;
  max-width: 40em;
  padding: 0;
}
```
