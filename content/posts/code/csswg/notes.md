summary: |
  As I spend more of my time
  working on the CSS language,
  I wanted a place to take notes
  and explore new ideas in the open.

The official conversation
for CSS language development
happens on
[The CSS Working Group GitHub issues](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) --
but it's useful to have
a more open notebook
for developing new ideas
before they are ready for Working Group discussion.

My notebook
is a public [collection of markdown files](https://github.com/oddbird/css-sandbox)
that are also generated into a static site
at css.oddbird.net.
