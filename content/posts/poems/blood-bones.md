I once fell in love and the sky turned gray turned
us all over in our graves and-slash-or we were sleeping
when I first saw you naked and together at last
and forever these things happen to us all
to the best of them and to us as well we fall from grace
and into love and out of again just like the clouds pass
the ketchup too shall pass the time pass the ketchup time
and again change happens and you can leave it at that
for all I care you can't be one thing forever
while the sun moves from the three hand to
the four and squirrels are collecting nuts so
where does that leave us alone and alone
and alone shattered and fucked up and full of
blood and bones you sack of shit I love you.
