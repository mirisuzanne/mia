  This post has been written
  and published,
  and filed away for safe keeping
  as an event that happened in my past.
  This post is also a live performance,
  and an invitation to engage.
  Thanks for dropping by.

I've had this site for a very long time --
though the domain and the underlying tech
(and most of the content)
has shifted more than once.
Is it still the same site,
if I can just take out all the words,
and put in new words?

(_yes_)

Over the last several years,
I've leaned --
or devolved? --
into an approach that is not quite
[digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
but also not 'posting' in a blog format.
It's become almost
a retroactive digital archive of shifting,
cross-referenced,
projects and events.
A digital timeline
of what happened along the way.

(_I have found
there are sometimes
good reasons to
[break a promise](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/link-promise/)_)

Lately I've been
feeling the _evaporative_
nature of so many art projects.
I work hard,
I'm proud of the work,
but once it's done
it becomes...
one more markdown entry to file away
with yaml metadata
in this digital cabinet.

A semi-sorted mound of detritus --
the results of living,
trying things,
changing my mind,
and trying something else.
A curriculum vitae,
with too much color and detail.

(_let me show you the lovely flier
from my latest
[live performance](/theater/pity-fear/)
and a single line
documenting [my first one](/theater/newworld/danny-deep/lights/)_)

That feeling has bled into
my relationship with social media.
I have a thought.
I hit publish.
There is no middle step.
I hit the nearest publish button I can find.
It's on Twitter.
A momentary live performance,
and then...

(_15 years on that site,
and all I have to show for it
are a load of lovely friends,
some acquaintances who seem swell,
a weirdly web-obsessed audience,
and a few reply guys_)

Somehow that all leads us here.
An attempt at reviving
something more alive
_inside the archive itself_.
[Adding WebMentions](/2022/06/04/indiweb/),
cleaning up the RSS feed,
and writing more...
short notes?

(_have a thought,
add a commit message,
wait for Netlify to publish_)

I've also been
reviving and curating my
Feedly account,
to get back in the habit
of following other personal sites.
Maybe even responding to them here?
Who knows,
maybe there's something to this
idea of a
[slow social](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/29/rss-3/)
back-and-forth.

(_this is a reply to
<a href="https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there" class="u-in-reply-to">
Matthias Ott</a>,
but you wouldn't know it yet_)

I'm attempting
to develop a new habit,
with this site at the center.
Not to post more or less,
but to think more carefully
about what I want from posting
in the first place.
There's no folder full of draft articles,
or trello board of ideas,
or resolution to post every day.
Only a mental reminder
that
_I'm already posting
all the time_.
Sharing,
replying,
testing ideas,
having a laugh.

_Social posting._
It's a way of thinking out loud,
and building relationships.
I'm just not doing it here.
Platforms like Twitter
make the flow of conversation so easy.
Too easy, sometimes.
Other times, just right.

I don't want to lose that.
But what if some of those thoughts --
some parts of the conversation --
could also have a home
(and a longer life) here?
What if this site wasn't only a log of past events,
but a place where _something can happen_?
Something social, even?

(_syndication really is cool sometimes_)

The latest post from Matthias
is a lovely reminder
urging us all to
[Just Put Stuff Out There](https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there) --
with a well-deserved shout-out
to Chris Coyier's
regular short posts
across a wide range of topics.
Both Chris and Matthias
have been a big inspiration
in pushing me to try this.

(_it would be super embarrassing
if this short note spirals into a long one_)

I already put stuff out there.
The problem I have here is a little different.
I tend towards the extremes.
I will either write
the most in-depth
[complete guide](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/)
possible --
or I will condense the entire thought
[into 240 characters](https://tweets.miriamsuzanne.com/1534946918509342726)
and hit send.

When I do start to get precious --
_ahem_ --
it is absolutely helpful to remember
I can 'just hit publish'.
But right now
it also feels helpful to take a second
and ask:
_What happens after I publish_?

(_I spent hours writing this,
and yes, I'm thoroughly embarrassed_)

## (an after-thought, a chaser, a postscript)

I spent part of my summer
in 2012 at the
[Naropa Summer Writing Program](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/education/naropa/).
It's a weird place,
and I had a lovely time.
Between classes,
there were often large group gatherings
in the auditorium.

Naropa keeps audio documentation
of every event on campus --
a tradition that goes back years.
Somewhere along the way,
it also became tradition to acknowledge that
when speaking.
Anyone who was handed a microphone
would prefix their thought
with the same strange phrase
(using their own name).
Here it type:

_Miriam Suzanne, for the archive --_
