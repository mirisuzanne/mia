      I'm posting about my site re-design
      _as it happens_,
      in a very non-linear process.
      The result is that some details
      become outdated quickly --
      like the number and names of my Cascade Layers.
      I think of this like _planned obsolescence_
      for blog posts,
      but I haven't yet figured out
      how to monetize it.
