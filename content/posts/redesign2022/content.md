{% import "content.macros.njk" as content %}

(Can I really call it
a ['no-demo' reno](/2022/08/07/minimal/),
when I keep moving all these files around?
I don't know. Maybe?
It was always going to be
a tenuous metaphor.)

When I asked Erin to comment
on a new idea for navigation,
she said
_it doesn't matter how you organize it,
you'll never be happy with the result._

_The problem isn't the navigation.
You just can't decide what the site is for._

## Why did I make this site in the first place?

I started building websites
as a way to market my first theater company.[^first]
It was a place for the audience
to see _what's playing this season_,
or find the (web 1.0) phone number
for reserving tickets.
There were clear reasons
for people to show up at our site,
and a clear set of goals
for them to achieve.

My personal sites have taken
a number of different forms.
For several years
I had a one-page 'business-card' website.
Short and simple.
My name, a few links,
and some aggressive
_aesthetic choices_:

{{ content.figure(
  data=v2008to2012,
  caption='My 2008-2012 business-card site. I call this _rainbow brutalism_.'
) }}

There's something refreshing about
a single-page site.
All it has to do
is send you somewhere else,
with a bit of flair.[^diving]
Meanwhile,
the target sites
each have a clear focus
defined by the brand and goals
of the project.

[^diving]: [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)
  calls web links
  _a diving board into darkness_.
  He means that as an insult,
  but I think it sounds rad.

But in 2012 I got frustrated,
and it's been all downhill from there.[^bike]

[^bike]: If you're on a bike,
  downhill is a good thing.
  Are we on a bike?

Another theater company had imploded from internal conflicts.
I was looking for new ways to get my art out,
become part of a local scene,
and _get published_.
To do that, I would have to sell myself more.
Better.
I wanted to have more of a 'presence' online --
to move from _lurking_ to _participating_.

I built a new website on Tumblr.[^Tumblr]
It was meant to be a digital resume/portfolio,
and also a place to write more,
and interact more directly
with a (very small) audience.
There was a blog on the front page,
and then another page
for all the same linked projects.

[^Tumblr]: [Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.com/)
  had just moved onto Tumblr at the time.
  I think that was the inspiration.

## Some things change, some things don't

The earliest styled archive I could find
is from 2014,
when I moved off Tumblr.
The navigation is still roughly the same:

{{ content.figure(
  data=v2014,
  caption='My 2014 blog site, becoming an active participant on the indieweb.'
) }}

Since then,
it seems like
I've redesigned the site every couple years.
For a while
the navigation became
more and more complex:

{{ content.figure(
  data=v2015to2018,
  caption='2015, 2016, & 2018 sites, with increasingly complicated navigation.'
) }}

But then I got frustrated
with trying to sort my projects into
discrete categories.
In 2019, I threw it out all the navigation
while switching to Eleventy.
The new design would rely on tags instead:

{{ content.figure(
  data=v2019to2022,
  caption='From 2019 to 2022, a series of variations on a tag-driven theme.'
) }}

It's interesting to look at those last few years.
It seems I've been struggling to determine
what belongs in 'navigation' vs 'filtering',
and how to highlight the most relevant contentâ€¦
while treating everything as equal.

That's what really strikes me --
the _sameness_ of all the content.
It doesn't matter if you're looking at
a blog post,
or a new album,
a book,
a theater production,
an open-source project,
or a talk that I'm giving next week.
There's no distinction at all.

Everything is a card on a timeline.
Every card has a title,
a date, a summary, and some tags.

## Art _and_ code? In this economy?

Around 2014,
I got an accountant
to help with self-employment taxes.
After looking over my finances,
she said
_It's cool that you do
so many different things,
but some day you'll have to grow up and pick one
to actually focus on._

Almost a decade later,
I just turned 40.
I still have a band, a theater, a web company,
and several writing projects underway.
I also have a new accountant.
This is my career now,
all of it, all at once.

I'm not saying she was wrong,
but I am saying
_it's never going to happen_.
I understand
that makes both my bio
and my website
a bit more complicated.

Ideally that
mixing of categories and labels
would lead to a site that is
_more varied and interesting_.
But it's possible
that my desire to keep
all these projects
on equal footing
has lead to a fear of variety instead.

Over at OddBird,
[Sondra](https://oddbird.net/authors/sondra/)
has been using
Sophia Prater's
[Object Oriented UX](https://www.ooux.com/)
as a guiding philosophy
for our design process.
I'm not an expert on the approach,
but there's a basic principle
that sticks with me:

As humans,
we understand the world through objects.
When we walk into a room,
we quickly process things like tables,
chairs, couches.
We recognize their familiar shapes,
and understand immediately how they can be used.
In an Object-Oriented UX,
we can aim for a similar
object-recognition:

- The same type of content
  ought to be recognizable
  no matter where it appears on the site.
- Different types of content
  ought to be distinct at a glance.

Ha. _Well, oops._

My first instinct
was to create a short list of object types like
_posts_, _books_, _albums_, _orgs_, _scripts_, _talks_, etc.
I thought maybe those objects
could form a new sort of navigation.
But right away, they started overlapping.
That's when Erin stepped in
to dismiss the entire idea.

All those things do exist on my site --
and they may be useful to think about
in terms of styling --
but they're still just _tags_.
And they're tags that I already use.
I think, in a sense,
they're too _specific_.

Looking back at previous versions of this site,
I'm struck by the original 'objects'
that I used back in 2012 and 2014.
They fit smoothly with
my more recent thought
that this site is
[both an archive, and a live event](/2022/06/17/hit-publish/):

By **archive**,
I don't mean content that is no longer current,
but content that exists here
as a sort of documentation --
a record of my life and work elsewhere:

- **Organizations** (OddBird, Teacup Gorilla, CSSWG)
  that I work with.
  In 2014 I called them _co-belligerents_.[^co]
- **Artifacts** that are the result of my/our work,
  like albums, books, specs, and open source projects.
- **Events** past, present, and future.
  These also tend to have two parts --
  the _script/talk_ which can be performed multiple times,
  and the individual _performances_.

[^co]: This is a phrase that I saw
  on a historical marker for a failed political uprising.
  I don't remember the details, only the phrasing.

By **live event**,
I mean content that exists as itself --
intended to show up on a website,
_in a feed_,
not as documentation of something else:

- **Posts** that I write.
- **Links** that I want to share.
- **Announcements** about upcoming _archival stuff_.
  I wrote a book, or I'm giving a talk, or whatever.

I think these categories
start to get at something more interesting,
or informative about
what this website is
and how it works.

## But why, though?

I still haven't addressed Erin's critique.

Over the last 8-10 years --
since I moved away from the single-page approach --
I've tried to re-imagine the
content architecture and navigation
of this site multiple times.
But I'm not sure I've spent much time reflecting
on the _purpose_ of the site.

The other day,
someone on Twitter told me:

> The homepage should always be a selling point.
> It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s selling yourself personally
> or the value of your blog.
> To be blunt,
> no one who landed on your personal site
> got there because they care about you personally.

I'm not sure that's entirely accurate.
I do actually have friends and family
who care about me,
_and also_ look at my site.
They just go to a different school.
You wouldn't know them.

But in 2012,
selling myself was front-of-mind.
I needed a resume and portfolio
of my experience and expertise.
I needed _work_.

I've also tried, sometimes,
to sell the results of my work.
The artifacts.
Books, albums, prints of my art, etc.

Both of those are reasonable objectives
for a personal site.
But it would also be reasonable
to have a personal site
that acts as more of public journal
(a _live journal_?) --
entirely unrelated to the concept of selling.
A site entirely dedicated
to the people who care about me personally.

I don't need this to be a professional site.
That's why I have
[OddBird.net](https://oddbird.net),
[TeacupGorilla.com](https://teacupgorilla.com),
and [GrapefruitLab.com](https://grapefruitlab.com).
This site can be anything I want.
Parts of this site are very personal,
and not at all appropriate
for a professional resume or portfolio.

This is my home, online.
Sorry for the mess.
Can I get you a glass of water?

A site can also be many shades,
combinations, and twists on
any or all of the above.
Often, my site is just
where I play around with ideas.
Or it's an extension of my
online social life --
which includes work,
but isn't limited to work.

My site is a place that I curate,
however I want.
There's an aspect of it that
is entirely for my personal enjoyment.
The fact that it's public is incidental.

Erin will tell you
that the reason I find this difficult
is because I've been trying to do
all of the above and more.
I've been trying to
_document my entire existence_,
and organize it into a story that makes sense.

Is that a problem?

I don't have an answer to this, exactly.
But I know that some of my own
conscious and unconscious goals
come from _a joy of making and sharing_,
and some of them come from _a fear_.
Irrelevance maybe?
Unemployment?

I've built my life around
a willingness to turn down better-paying jobs
in order to protect my voice and my time.
But the flip side has been
a rollercoaster of freelancing highs and lows,
and a fear that I need to
always keep selling.[^selling]
Sometimes that's been a helpful motivation,
but I don't think it's as relevant now
as it was in 2012.

[^selling]: I would like to sell you
  my mediocre personality,
  and terrible humor.
  These aren't my best qualities,
  but you can have them both for only
  ~~$9.99~~ ++$4.99 and a back-link++.)

## What can a website be?

[Robin Rendle](https://robinrendle.com/),
who has continued to inspire this redesign,
seems to be thinking through
some similar questions
(in much more concise posts).

[_About the redesign_](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/about-the-redesign/)
is an excellent reflection
on their process so far --
what's working, and what isn't.
Then also,
[_All the things a post can be_](https://robinrendle.com/notes/all-the-things-a-blog-post-can-be/):

> Saccharine, careless, melancholic, naive, questioning,
> questionable, dashing, daring, and vengeful. Inquisitive.
> Soaring! Doubtful, distrustful, apprehensive, hesitant, unready,
> unabridged, undecided, unwavering. Woeful. ...

It goes on. I love it.
An expansive set of options,
all interesting in their own way.
I wonder what a website can be?
What can my website be?
I need to sit with this more.

In writing and theater projects,
I'll often start by working through
this set of prompts from
[Anne Bogart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bogart):

> 1. What is the question that motivates the piece?
> 2. Who or what is the anchor through which we explore the question?
> 3. What is the structure of our exploration?

I'm also reminded of the questions
that Abigail Thorn uses
to guide [Philosophy Tube](https://www.youtube.com/user/thephilosophytube):

> 1. Is it made from curiosity, not ambition?
> 2. Is it made out of compassion for myself and others?
> 3. Is it my unique creative vision?

Some things to think about.

All that to say,
Erin has a point.
_Which is rude._

[^first]: A simple 'database' of shows --
  hand-written CSV files --
  with a PHP script
  to give me server-side includes.
