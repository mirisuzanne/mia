      and on the rim --
      set on a hexagon tray
      with stalagmites protruding
      around the pot base

  It wasn't always a great year,
  but I've been
  [moving the right direction](/2023/05/06/2023-preview/).
  In 2024, the plan is to
  _just keep moving_.
  (maybe too literally)

{% import "content.macros.njk" as content %}

I don't like to define my year
as a series of measurable OKRs
achieved or failed.
To quote [Robin Rendle](https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/):
_I am a poem, I am not software_.
But at the end of 2022
my anxiety was pretty high,
and I was feeling pretty low.
So I set out to
[turn things around](/2023/05/06/2023-preview/):

> I want to cultivate a spacious openness
> for curiosity and discoveryâ€¦
> So that when I am busy,
> it should be from
> _an abundance of creative projects,
> not a scarcity of time_.

Now, heading into another new year,
I want to celebrate and re-affirm that direction.
I haven't _made progress_ exactly,
because there's no end goal,
and no metrics --
but I'm feeling a lot better
about how I waste my time.
I'm feeling better about
_having time to waste_.
Not because my days are any less full,
but because I'm the one filling them up.

Here are some things I enjoyed in 2023.
And some projects that will continue
into the new year!

{{ content.figure(

  "Following my curiosity. Maybe I should take up lock picking next?"
) }}

- I performed in [Curious Theatre](https://www.curioustheatre.org/)'s
  New Voices festival,
  and designed lights for
  their regional premier
  [_Letters of Suresh_](https://www.curioustheatre.org/event/lettersofsuresh/)
- [Grapefruit Lab](https://grapefruitlab.com)
  has officially formed as a non-profit,
  and we should hear soon about getting 501c3 status
- Our spring show
  [_Strange Bird, Queer Bird_](https://grapefruitlab.com/shows/queer-bird/)
  was a huge success,
  and a fun opportunity to work with new collaborators
- [Teacup Gorilla](https://teacupgorilla.com)
  has mostly finished recording a new album,
  and we're collaborating with Grapefruit Lab
  to make a fully-staged live performance
  based on it (opening in May!)
- I got really into clock repair,
  and I've fixed several old wall clocks
  for friends
  (I even made a video about
  [the Rack and Snail strike mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntNzVlqbwPM&t=198s))
- I joined [DenHac](https://denhac.org/),
  the local maker space,
  and learned a number of new tools --
  from laser cutting and 3d printing,
  to the metal lathe and
  (just this week)
  the embroidery machine
- I've been learning parametric CAD,
  using OnShape and Fusion 360
  along with the DenHac tools
  to design a mechanical pendulum clock
  from scratch
- I've started exploring
  custom elements and web components
  (huge thanks to Zach Leatherman
  and Westbrook Johnson for significant guidance)
- I'm half done with a major re-build of this site,
  and a few other web side projects
  that I want to get back to
- I joined a the local recreation center
  pottery class,
  and really enjoyed getting my hands
  back into the clay
  (classes start again soon!)
- I did "something active outside"
  (usually a walk) _every day of the year_
  (though some days were much more active than others)

I absolutely love my daily walks,
and plan to keep that up.
I thought I might track another daily
(or weekly?) habit this year --
I'd like to get back into
a regular creative writing practice.
It might even be fun to re-program
my [Yetch calendar](https://yetch.store/products/every-day-goal-calendar),
so it can track multiple habits at once.
I also have some ideas to make
[Front-End Social](https://front-end.social/)
more sustainable
over the long term.
But all that will have to wait
for another couple months.
That's ok,
there's plenty of time.

For now, I'm moving
and preparing
[a new CSS workshop](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/modern-css-miriam-suzanne/) for Feb/March.
I'm really excited about this one,
and have big plans
to do more teaching for work this year.
Maybe even make some videos again?

But more immediate
than any of that,
Erin and I spent the holidays
cleaning and painting our condos --
putting anything we can into
friends' basements.
This home that I've curated for myself
for the last eight years
no longer feels like mine,
and it will go on the market next weekend.
I'm sad to leave,
but excited to start something new.

Having separate space
has been important to us here,
and will be important to us
in a new home as well --
but without the public hallway between,
and no need for the extra kitchen.

Bring on the new year.

_(oh fuck. the election. we're fucked.)_
