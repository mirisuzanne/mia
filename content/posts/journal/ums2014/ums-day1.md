So many people! So much music!
And **Elin Palmer** is a badass on the
Nyckelharpa.

Tonight â€” Daniel is playing with both
**Raven Jane** (7pm @ Moes Original BBQ),
and **The Truth & Spectacle**
(midnight @ The Hornet).
Also at midnight,
**Accordion Crimes**
is worth checking out
if you like Fugazi-style noise
coming from an aluminum guitar.
