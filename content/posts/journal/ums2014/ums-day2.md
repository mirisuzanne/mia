I'm overwhelmed by all the music! At this point I wander half-aimless,
in and out of venues — quick to judge, but more often inspired. Glad to
discover that most of my favorites are local, and I can stalk them like
a groupie until the next UMS arrives again.

I've always loved
**Accordion Crimes**
and they pulled through
again last night — full of dynamic surprise.
**Mako1972** has a similar post-punk thing
going, which I always enjoy.
**Raven Jane** and
**The Truth & Spectacle** were excellent
(from our unbiased opinion of Daniel in a hat).
I've followed **Ian Cooke** for a while, and was glad to see
him returning to a simpler, cello-driven sound. Only caught the tail-end
of **StaG**, but they earned another listen.
**Saturn Cowboys** was a raucous fun time,
and **Dragondeer** got the whole room (including
us) excited like no effect-heavy lead mandolin has ever done before.

This was a wonderful night of live/local music, but my favorite
discovery was the intricate shoe-gazing soundscapes of
**Dave Devine Relay**.
