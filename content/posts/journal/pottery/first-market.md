    A nearly-spherical vase
    with a small protruding foot ring and lip,
    and textured grooves
    highlighted by
    the green-gray glaze
    that breaks red-brown over the texture.
summary: >
  Saturday I had my first pottery market.
  But just a few days before the event,
  Rae handed me some cash
  and took home a moon vase.

    A few of the
    commissioned pieces
    for friends

    - img: art/pottery/2025/tray-top.jpg
      alt: >
        Rectangular tray with a black and white
        zig-zag pattern that starts tidy on the left
        then skews wildly on the right -
        the lip of the tray is red
        and folds over itself ending in torn edges
    - img: art/pottery/2025/tray-angle.jpg
      alt: >
        Tray from a low angle for dramatic effect,
        showing the torn edges close-up,
        and the black underside
    - img: art/pottery/2025/coroner-in.jpg
      alt: >
        Old yellow dress form with holes for arms and neck,
        and patch nailed onto it
        that says coroner -
        there's a planter protruding from the neck,
        housing a ponytail fern
        squat conic trunk
        up to scraggly hair-like leaves
    - img: art/pottery/2025/coroner-out.jpg
      alt: >
        My arm reaches in to hold the coroner head
        out of the dress form,
        revealing a long bent cone
        with deep texture and pooled white glaze
        at the rounded-off base
        which would not be able to sit in any other location
    - img: art/pottery/2025/shallow.jpg
      alt: >
        A set of four shallow bowls stacked,
        with one overturned leaning against the others
        to show the deep foot ring
        and under-side texture.
        They have a deep glassy brown glaze
        with a splash of white and blue
        along one inside wall

    Some of the pieces
    that I made for this market
  data:
    - img: art/pottery/2025/color-mugs.jpg
      alt: >
        Four 12oz tumblers with a deep inset foot ring,
        wide base, and grooved speckled walls
        sloping in to a narrower brightly glazed lip -
        one red, one green, one blue, and one white
    - img: art/pottery/2025/trans-mugs.jpg
      alt: >
        Three tumblers,
        also wide base with grooved walls sloped in -
        but the clay is brown un-speckled,
        the lips are an icy white,
        and they have hand-written text.
        The front one says "do trans, be crime".
        We can also see the end of "…crimes"
        sticking out on one behind,
        and "protect trans kids" on the last one
    - img: art/pottery/2025/pour-mug.jpg
      alt: >
        v60 style coffee pour-over
        with frosty glaze highlighting dark clay
        that shows through at edges,
        an inverted cone down to a flat lid
        resting on the rim of a mug,
        which is slightly conic the other way -
        tilting in from a wide base,
        also in dark clay with the same glaze only at the top.
        Both have a grooved texture,
        and there's a row of small white arrows
        on the mug between grooves
    - img: art/pottery/2025/red-cortado-hand.jpg
      alt: >
        My hand holding up a red-clay
        cortado-size tumbler with grooved texture,
        inset foot ring,
        and white-brown glazed rim.
        There's just a peak of teal
        showing inside the foot ring,
        usually hidden.
    - img: art/pottery/2025/pour-bottom.jpg
      alt: >
        The pour-over from underneath,
        showing a glazed base
        with concentric outer and inner rings
        around the funnel to keep the mug in position
        and the coffee flowing into the mug.
        My 'm' stamp stands out on the rim, dark clay unglazed
    - img: art/pottery/2025/cortado-arrows.jpg
      alt: >
        A small black tumbler, maybe 6oz,
        with red drippy-looking arrows pointing
        up to a grey-brown glazed rim
    - img: art/pottery/2025/gaiwan-pour.jpg
      alt: >
        My hand holding a lidded gaiwan tea bowl
        just over the saucer -
        one finger pulling the lid back
        as though to pour tea strained through
        the small opening.
        All the parts are a glassy deep brown,
        breaking red over grooved textures,
        and the bowl has a wide flared rim
        for picking up when hot
    - img: art/pottery/2025/gaiwan-parts.jpg
      alt: >
        Overturned parts of the gaiwan,
        a lid on the table,
        the bottom of the bowl shows a
        bare white clay foot ring
        and my 'm' stamp,
        and the saucer now leaning against it
        has a matching grooved pattern on the underside
        and matching white foot-ring
    - img: art/pottery/2025/espresso.jpg
      alt: >
        9 tea or espresso cups
        about 2-3oz, stacked together
        rim-to-rim, and foot-to-foot -
        four in front, three behind,
        and two on the table.
        A dark dusk glaze breaks red over grooved texture,
        and has hints of blue between.
        each has a red rim, and no handle.
    - img: art/pottery/2025/ice-vase.jpg
      alt: >
        Two vases,
        one upright, the other on it's side
        so we can see into it -
        both conic like my mugs but taller,
        and with a rim that curves
        back down into the vase slightly
        to a narrower inset lip.
        A brown raw clay has deep grooves
        and little trails of red arrows,
        then a white rim at the top
    - img: art/pottery/2025/ramen-notch.jpg
      alt: >
        Two nearly identical soup bowls
        nested so we see the outer one from the side,
        a grooved texture that shows through
        the glassy dark brown-to-black-and iridescent blue.
        A rounded shape with a tall speckled clay foot ring
        and my small 'm' stamp.
        The inner bowl is off-kilter
        showing inside walls, smooth in the same glaze
        from a red-brown rim down into cosmic blues
        and a splash of yellow to one side.
    - img: art/pottery/2025/ramen-sticks.jpg
      alt: >
        One of the ramen bowls,
        with chop-sticks sitting across
        a set of shallow notches in the rim
    - img: art/pottery/2025/market-06-25.jpg
      alt: >
        A whole set of mugs and pour-overs,
        gaiwan, vases,
        and other assorted pieces
        laid out on the counter.
        Towards the back are taller vases
        out of focus.

    currently under construction…

    - img: art/pottery/2025/sake-bottle-wet.jpg
      alt: >
        A medium-size sake bottle in coal black clay,
        still wet on the wheel,
        with a barely rounded belly,
        narrow neck, and cup-like rim
    - img: art/pottery/2025/milk-jug.jpg
      alt: >
        a tall cylindrical vase
        with straight walls up to a sharp angle in,
        then sharp angle back out,
        ending in a horizontal flared rim
        nearly the same diameter as the cylinder -
        reminiscent of an old-style milk-jug,
        but still wet on the wheel
        with splattered clay and tools around
    - img: art/pottery/2025/tissues-bisque.jpg
      alt: >
        A rectangular tissue-box cover
        in raw unglazed clay that has a
        circular geometric pattern pressed into it.
        The opening at the top seems torn and pulled back,
        with tissues sticking out -
        and the bottom rim is a torn and rolled edge
        as though made of draped cloth,
        or alive like some sort of sea creature

I started doing weekly pottery
sessions at the local rec center
a couple years ago, coming out of lock-down.
But last fall I decided to commit more time,
and joined a studio with 24hr access.
Now I'm checking in almost daily
to throw, trim, decorate,
or see what's fresh out of a firing.

The first several months of 2025
were dedicated _practice_ --
working my way through online courses
from (mostly) [Mea Rhee](https://learnpottery.weebly.com).
I've also been taking assignments from friends --
planters and ramen bowls
and a tissue box cover for our new home,
shallow dishes for Lars,
a gaiwan tea set for Gwyn,
a trinket tray for Rae…

  data=commission.data,
  caption=commission.caption

I have a lot more that I'm excited to learn,
but I'm also proud of how far I've come.
This month I even started teaching
_beginner wheel throwing_ classes
at [Kinship Studio](https://www.kinshipdenver.com/).
I'll be teaching the Tuesday class
again in July, and
[registration is still open](https://www.kinshipdenver.com/group-pottery-classes/#signup)!

Since teaching covers my studio membership,
I'm no longer _spending money_
to make my pottery.
First goal achieved!
The next goal is to
_sell_ some pottery,
then see if I can sell it _consistently_.
I'm starting to pitch local shops,
putting together a web store,
trading pottery for hair cuts,
and this weekend
I participated in my first market!

{{ content.figure(
  data=market.data,
  caption=market.caption
) }}

I'm aware of the dangers that come
with turning a hobby into a hustle,
but right now I'm interested in anything
that helps me spend more time in the studio.
I'm already back to work on some commissions
I've promised to local shops and also to family.

{{ content.figure(
  data=progress.data,
  caption=progress.caption
) }}

At some point I also need to find time
for getting this website in a better state --
ready to display (and sell)
my work more easily.

If you're interested in updates
on my pottery or other creations,
sign up for my new
'[Mia Culpa](https://email.miriamsuzanne.com)' newsletter.
It will be rarely used,
but give you first access
when I do have something new to show,
or new work available
in my [online store](https://art.miriamsuzanne.com).
