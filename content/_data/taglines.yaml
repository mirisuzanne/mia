  This is not what I had in mind.
  I thought my website would be way cooler than this.
  I wanted to make something like
  the [1996 SpaceJam site](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.html),
  but about me instead.
  Maybe I should add more stars in the background.
  How many background stars is the right number of background stars?

  Someone told me that my home page
  should always be selling something.

  Aristotle says that tragedy is
  _the imitation of an action that is serious, and complete,
  and of a certain magnitude._

  Constrained even.
  _Certain_.
  This website might look like a tragedy,
  but it isn't.

  Miriam is unavailable to attend
  this rendering of her website,
  and sends her deepest regrets.
  In the meantime,
  the role of digital-Miriam
  will be played by an understudy.
  Thank you for your patience and understanding.

  The origin of the name Miriam isn't known for certain,
  but there are several theories,
  including _sea of bitterness_,
  or _beloved_, or _wished-for child_.
