What if a social network becomes so that you don't feel comfortable there anymore? Or it gets shut down altogether? In that case, what happens to all your posts?</p>\n<p>In my opinion, your digital identity should belong to you and not to a commercial company. You should be the sole owner of the content you share online. And that's what IndieWeb encourages people to do.</p>\n<h2>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#what-is-the-indieweb\"></a>What is the IndieWeb?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the 'corporate web'. - IndieWeb.org</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The core idea of the IndieWeb is that you are identified by a URL. You have control over a particular website or web presence. You write posts on that website, and those posts are permalinked. Other people can subscribe to feeds of your website and your web posts. You add additional markup to the HTML of your website to provide automatically readable endpoints. This way, machines can also assign meaning to your content.</p>\n<p>Basically, the IndieWeb is the web. It's HTML files that make up a website. There is no defined service aspect.\nYou can use <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices\">Microservices</a>[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices] for things like.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieAuth\">IndieAuth</a>[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieAuth],</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention\">Webmentions</a>[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention] or</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropub_(protocol)\">Micropub</a>[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropub_(protocol)].</li>\n</ul><h2>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#a-joomla-website-in-the-indieweb\"></a>A Joomla website in the IndieWeb</h2>\n<p>Alright, at this point I will describe the steps I took to set up my Joomla website for the IndieWeb. The website <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">indiewebify.me</a>, was a great help in this.</p>\n<p>I already owned a domain and storage space to host a website. This is a prerequisite to become a \"citizen of the IndieWeb\".</p>\n<p>I decided to use Joomla plugins and create them so that they can be used in any template.</p>\n<h3>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#become-a-citizen-of-indieweb-level-1\"></a>Become a citizen of IndieWeb Level 1</h3>\n<h4>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#get-your-own-domain-name\"></a>Get your own domain name</h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/personal-domain\">personal domain</a> is an identifier that gives you control over your space, just like other identities like email address or phone number. I already own a domain and webspace to host a website. This is a requirement to become a \"citizen of the IndieWeb\". If you own a Joomla website, you certainly meet this requirement as well.</p>\n<h4>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#set-up-web-sign-in\"></a>Set up Web Sign In</h4>\n<p>To be able to log in with your domain name via <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain\">Web Sign In</a>, you connect it to your existing identities.</p>\n<p>You probably already have many profiles on the web. If you link them to your domain name using the microformat <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\"><code>rel=me</code></a>, it is easy to see that you are the same person on Google, Twitter, Github, Flickr, Facebook, email and that this person belongs to your domain name.</p>\n<h5>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#my-way-of-doing\"></a>My way of doing</h5>\n<p>Um dich mit deinem Domänennamen per <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain\">Web Sign In</a> anmelden zu können, verbindest du diesen mit deinen bestehenden Identitäten.</p>\n<p>Wahrscheinlich hast du bereits viele Profile im Web. Wenn du diese mit dem Mikroformat <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\"><code>rel=me</code></a> mit deinem Domänennamen verknüpfst, ist es leicht zu erkennen, dass du bei Google, Twitter, Github, Flickr, Facebook, E-Mail dieselbe Person bist und diese Person zu deiner Domänenname gehört.</p>\n<p>In a content plugin I have inserted a parameter where you insert your <code>rel=me</code>. The plugin reads this out with the following code.</p>\n<pre><code><span><span><span>// Web Sign In</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> = </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> . </span><span>'&lt;div class=\"hidden\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;'</span><span>;</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> = </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> . </span><span>'&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=\"me\" href=\"mailto:'</span><span> . </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>email</span><span> . </span><span>'\"&gt;'</span><span> . </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>email</span><span> . </span><span>'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;'</span><span>;</span></span></span>\n<span><span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>foreach</span><span> (</span><span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>params</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'websignin'</span><span>) as </span><span>$websigninitem</span><span>) {</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>    </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> = </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> . </span><span>'&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=\"me\" href=\"'</span><span> . </span><span>$websigninitem</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>websignin_url</span><span> . </span><span>'\"&gt;'</span><span> . </span><span>$websigninitem</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>websignin_url</span><span> . </span><span>'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;'</span><span>;</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>}</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> = </span><span>$row</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span><span> . </span><span>'&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span><span>;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p><span style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:800px;\">\n      <a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/static/4a85e83e5aa3c8607c8085ea2ca3ba45/84a78/cassiopeia_indieweb_1.png\">\n    <span style=\"padding-bottom:46.5%;\"></span>\n  <img alt=\"Set up Web Sign In\" title=\"Set up Web Sign In\" src=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/static/4a85e83e5aa3c8607c8085ea2ca3ba45/5a190/cassiopeia_indieweb_1.png\" style=\"margin:0;vertical-align:middle;\" /></a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In the HTML source code of the post view, the relations are listed.</p>\n<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>=</span><span>\"hidden\"</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span><span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>joomla-hidden-mail</span><span>  </span><span>is-link</span><span>=</span><span>\"1\"</span><span> </span><span>is-email</span><span>=</span><span>\"1\"</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span>=</span><span>\"aW5mbw==\"</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>=</span><span>\"YXN0cmlkLWd1ZW50aGVyLmRl\"</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>=</span><span>\"aW5mb0Bhc3RyaWQtZ3VlbnRoZXIuZGU=\"</span><span> </span><span>base</span><span>=</span><span>\"\"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>This email address is being protected from spambots.

This allows a site visitor to the other site to see that it has been linked to your site. Sending webmentions allows you to post replies to other content on your own site and participate in cross-site conversations. Sounds complicated? Well, it's just like any other social network where you react to a post by commenting or liking it.</p>\n<p>I have not automated the creation of the webmentions up to now. I use this <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me/send-webmentions/\">form</a>[indiewebify.me/send-webmentions/] for this purpose to get started.</p>\n<h3>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#federating-indieweb-conversations-level-3\"></a>Federating IndieWeb Conversations Level 3</h3>\n<h4>\n<a href=\"https://blog.astrid-guenther.de/en/cassiopeia-joomla-indieweb/#add-reply-to-your-page\"></a>Add reply to your page</h4>\n<p>Posting <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/reply\">replies</a> to other people's posts is the next step after mentioning them with webmention.</p>\n<p>Normally, a reply is a <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/note\">note</a> like any other, plus it links to the post it is replying to. If it is marked with <code>h-entry</code> and <code>rel=in-reply-to</code> and/or <code>class=u-in-reply-to</code>, the reply may appear as a comment on the original post.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To test whether sending webmentions works, try replying to a post by someone who has implemented receiving comments. There is a list <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/webmention#IndieWeb_implementations\">on the wiki</a>[^indieweb.org/webmention#IndieWeb_implementations].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want, you can also go a step further and show a copy of the post you are replying to.

        "text": "The IndieWeb[^indieweb.org/] is about taking control of your content, sharing your thoughts and ideas in one place and then spreading them on other social platforms. What if a social network becomes so that you don't feel comfortable there anymore? Or it gets shut down altogether? In that case, what happens to all your posts?\nIn my opinion, your digital identity should belong to you and not to a commercial company. You should be the sole owner of the content you share online. And that's what IndieWeb encourages people to do.\n\nWhat is the IndieWeb?\n\nThe IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the 'corporate web'. - IndieWeb.org\n\nThe core idea of the IndieWeb is that you are identified by a URL. You have control over a particular website or web presence. You write posts on that website, and those posts are permalinked. Other people can subscribe to feeds of your website and your web posts. You add additional markup to the HTML of your website to provide automatically readable endpoints. This way, machines can also assign meaning to your content.\nBasically, the IndieWeb is the web. It's HTML files that make up a website. There is no defined service aspect.\nYou can use Microservices[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices] for things like.\n\nIndieAuth[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieAuth],\n\nWebmentions[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention] or\n\nMicropub[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropub_(protocol)].\n\nA Joomla website in the IndieWeb\nAlright, at this point I will describe the steps I took to set up my Joomla website for the IndieWeb. The website indiewebify.me, was a great help in this.\nI already owned a domain and storage space to host a website. This is a prerequisite to become a \"citizen of the IndieWeb\".\nI decided to use Joomla plugins and create them so that they can be used in any template.\n\nBecome a citizen of IndieWeb Level 1\n\nGet your own domain name\nA personal domain is an identifier that gives you control over your space, just like other identities like email address or phone number. I already own a domain and webspace to host a website. This is a requirement to become a \"citizen of the IndieWeb\". If you own a Joomla website, you certainly meet this requirement as well.\n\nSet up Web Sign In\nTo be able to log in with your domain name via Web Sign In, you connect it to your existing identities.\nYou probably already have many profiles on the web. If you link them to your domain name using the microformat rel=me, it is easy to see that you are the same person on Google, Twitter, Github, Flickr, Facebook, email and that this person belongs to your domain name.\n\nMy way of doing\nUm dich mit deinem Domänennamen per Web Sign In anmelden zu können, verbindest du diesen mit deinen bestehenden Identitäten.\nWahrscheinlich hast du bereits viele Profile im Web. Wenn du diese mit dem Mikroformat rel=me mit deinem Domänennamen verknüpfst, ist es leicht zu erkennen, dass du bei Google, Twitter, Github, Flickr, Facebook, E-Mail dieselbe Person bist und diese Person zu deiner Domänenname gehört.\nIn a content plugin I have inserted a parameter where you insert your rel=me. The plugin reads this out with the following code.\n// Web Sign In\n$row->text = $row->text . '<div class=\"hidden\"><ul>';\n$row->text = $row->text . '<li><a rel=\"me\" href=\"mailto:' . $row->email . '\">' . $row->email . '</a></li>';\n\nforeach ($this->params->get('websignin') as $websigninitem) {\n    $row->text = $row->text . '<li><a rel=\"me\" href=\"' . $websigninitem->websignin_url . '\">' . $websigninitem->websignin_url . '</a></li>';\n}\n$row->text = $row->text . '</ul></div>';\n\n      \n    \n  \n    \nIn the HTML source code of the post view, the relations are listed.\n<div class=\"hidden\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><joomla-hidden-mail  is-link=\"1\" is-email=\"1\" first=\"aW5mbw==\" last=\"YXN0cmlkLWd1ZW50aGVyLmRl\" text=\"aW5mb0Bhc3RyaWQtZ3VlbnRoZXIuZGU=\" base=\"\" >This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</joomla-hidden-mail>\n    </li>\n    <li><a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://fimidi.com/@astrid\">https://fimidi.com/@astrid</a>\n    </li>\n    <li><a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://github.com/astridx\">https://github.com/astridx</a>\n    </li>\n    <li><a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://twitter.com/astridguenther\">https://twitter.com/astridguenther</a>\n    </li>\n    <li><joomla-hidden-mail  is-link=\"1\" is-email=\"0\" first=\"aW5mbw==\" last=\"YXN0cmlkLWd1ZW50aGVyLmRl\" text=\"bWFpbHRvOmluZm9AYXN0cmlkLWd1ZW50aGVyLmRl\" base=\"\" >This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</joomla-hidden-mail>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\nIt is now important that you include a link back to your website on each of the other websites. It is important that this is also provided with a rel=me!\n\nWould you like to test the login via e-mail address? Register with webmention.io via your website. You will receive an e-mail to the rel=\"me\" e-mail address with which you authenticate yourself.\n\nIf you use emails with rel=me, it is necessary to deactivate the plugin Content - Email cloack.\n\nPublishing on the IndieWeb Level 2\n\nTag your content (profile, notes, articles, etc...) with microformats2\n\nOther people can read and understand the information you publish on your website. By adding some simple class names to the HTML code, machines can also evaluate and understand it. This is useful for things like Feedback, Comments or Event-RSVPs.\n\nMy way of doing\nUsing a plugin, I added h-card and h-entry as hidden HTML elements to the content of the Joomla website. Unfortunately, the content is duplicated, but this ensures that the design of the template is not touched. It may be necessary to add the CSS class hidden to the template. The Joomla standard template Cassiopeia has this by default.\n$row->text = $row->text . '<article class=\"hidden h-entry\">\n<h1 class=\"p-name\">' . $row->title . '</h1>\n<p>Published by \n<a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"' . $row->webpage . '\">' . $row->authorname . '</a> on \n\n<time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"' . $row->publish_up . '\">' . $row->publish_up . '</time>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p-summary\">' . $row->introtext . '</p>\n<div class=\"e-content\">' . str_replace($row->introtext, '', $row->text) . '</div>\n</article>';\n\nYou can test the syntax using indiewebify.me.\n\n\nWebmentions to send to other IndieWeb sites\nIf you reply to something on another IndieWeb site or mention someone with an IndieWeb site, you can send a webmention. This allows a site visitor to the other site to see that it has been linked to your site. Sending webmentions allows you to post replies to other content on your own site and participate in cross-site conversations. Sounds complicated? Well, it's just like any other social network where you react to a post by commenting or liking it.\nI have not automated the creation of the webmentions up to now. I use this form[indiewebify.me/send-webmentions/] for this purpose to get started.\n\nFederating IndieWeb Conversations Level 3\n\nAdd reply to your page\nPosting replies to other people's posts is the next step after mentioning them with webmention.\nNormally, a reply is a note like any other, plus it links to the post it is replying to. If it is marked with h-entry and rel=in-reply-to and/or class=u-in-reply-to, the reply may appear as a comment on the original post.\n\nTo test whether sending webmentions works, try replying to a post by someone who has implemented receiving comments. There is a list on the wiki[^indieweb.org/webmention#IndieWeb_implementations].\n\nIf you want, you can also go a step further and show a copy of the post you are replying to. This is called Reply Context.\n\nMy way of doing\nI add the following code snippet to the post via Content Plugin, replacing the permalink with a correct one.\n<div class=\"u-in-reply-to h-cite\">\n<a class=\"u-url\" href=\"permalink\"></a>\n</div>\n\nGet webmentions on your site\nNow that you are able to post replies that appear as comments on others' sites, the next step is to be able to receive comments yourself. There are several ways to do this. I make it easy for myself and implement the [webmention.io](http://webmention.io/ service. Now all that was missing was a way to display the webmentions. For a start, I add the url below the content.\n\nMy way of doing\nIch habe ein Zusammenspiel von drei Plugins implementiert.\n\nSystem Plugin\nVia System Plugin schreibe ich die notwendigen Informationen in den head der Website.\n\nTask Plugin\nVia Task Plugin I fetch webmentions from https://webmention.io once a day and save them in a file. For this, a token https://webmention.io of is required, which I insert per parameter in the settings for the plugin.\n    private function writewebmentionFile(string $config): int\n    {\n        $file = $this->webmentionFile;\n\n        try {\n            $curl = curl_init();\n            curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=' . $this->params->get('token'));\n            curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\n\n            $response = curl_exec($curl);\n\n            if ($response === false) {\n                $curlError = curl_error($curl);\n                curl_close($curl);\n                throw new ApiException('cURL Error: ' . $curlError);\n            }\n\n            $httpCode = curl_getinfo($curl, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);\n\n            if ($httpCode >= 400) {\n                curl_close($curl);\n                $responseParsed = json_decode($response);\n                throw new ApiException('HTTP Error ' . $httpCode .\n                    ' (' . $responseParsed->error->type . '): ' . $responseParsed->error->message);\n            }\n\n            curl_close($curl);\n\n            File::write($file, $response);\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n\n        ....\n\n        return Status::OK;\n    }\n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n\nContent Plugin\nI read out the webmentions out of the file saved by the task plugin in the content plugin each time they are called up and display them in the post.\n$webmention_file = JPATH_BASE . '/plugins/task/indieweb/webmentions.json';\n$webmentions = file_get_contents($webmention_file);\n$webmentions = json_decode($webmentions);\n\n$webmentions_urls = \"\";\nif ($webmentions !== null) {\n    foreach ($webmentions->children as $i => $webmention) {\n        if (str_contains($webmention->{'mention-of'}, $row->alias)) {\n            $webmentions_urls = $webmentions_urls . '<a href=\"' . $webmention->url . '\">' . $webmention->url . '</a></br>';\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n$row->text = $row->text . '<div><b>Webmentions</b>\n' . $webmentions_urls . '</div>';\n\n\nSyndication and Backfeed\nA puzzle for me were two terms I came across while reading. They seem to belong to the IndieWeb. They are POSSE and Backfeed. I can't quite place them, so I'll add them at the end.\nPOSSE means that you publish your content on your own site first and then post links on other social platforms.\n\nPublish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere\n\nYou do this, for example, by tweeting about your post and linking to your website.\nBackfeed describes the process of pulling the interactions of your POSSE copy to the original post. So if someone comments on a tweet with the link to your post, it will actually link back to your website as a webmention.\nAdding syndication markup is straightforward, it's another microformat that can be manually added to content.\n\nMy procedure\nI add a pattern via editor-xtd plugin.\n{loadsyndication syndicationurl1,syndicationurl1,syndicationurl1}\n\n      \n    \n  \n    \nThen adapt this pattern via Content Plugin.\n...\n$syndication_urls = '<div><b>Syndication</b><ol>';\n\n$regex = '/{loadsyndication\\s(.*?)}/i';\n$matcheslist = array();\npreg_match_all($regex, $row->text, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);\nif ($matches) {\n    foreach ($matches as $match) {\n        $matcheslist = explode(',', $match[1]);\n    }\n}\n\nforeach ($matcheslist as $i => $matche) {\n    $syndication_urls = $syndication_urls . '<li><a class=\"u-syndication\" rel=\"syndication\" href=\"' . $matche . '\">' . $matche . '</a></li>';\n}\n\n$syndication_urls = $syndication_urls .

According to my browser history, I visited \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org\" title=\"IndieWeb.org\">IndieWeb.org</a>\n on June 15, 2022, so around a month ago. I read up on <strong>Miriam Suzanne</strong>’s hugely popular post \n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\" title=\"Am I on the IndieWeb Yet?\">Am I on the IndieWeb Yet?</a>\n and searched Google for “hugo indieweb” in the hopes there was some kind of \n<a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/micro/2021/05/indieweb-recipe\" title=\"recipe\">recipe</a>\n to get me started on my static page (I’m a developer and after all *<em>let’s say it all together</em>* developers are lazy).</p>\n<p>There wasn’t THE ONE answer I was hoping for, but instead lot’s and lot’s of blog posts by people describing their way of getting into the IndieWeb. I was overwhelmed and intrigued at the same time, so I let it rest for a couple of days - four, to be exact. The afternoon of June 20, 2022, I went deep, even deeper than \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjcA2xSH25Y\" title=\"Jamiroquai\">Jamiroquai</a>\n, into the rabbit hole that is <strong>The IndieWeb</strong>. Let’s retrace my steps through said browser history and commits.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/07/indiewebify-me-and-dont-forget-my-webmentions/#whats-indieweb\">\n      Link</a>What’s IndieWeb?\n</h2><blockquote>\n<p>The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. - \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org\" title=\"IndieWeb.org\">IndieWeb.org</a>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s what it says on the cover. It’s about owning your content, sharing your thoughts and ideas in one place and then syndicating it to other (social) platforms. What if Twitter, for example, will be bought by a stupidly rich philanthropist who decides to shut it down? Where will all your tweets go?</p>\n<p>In my opinion, your Twitter or your Facebook profile should not be your digital identity, owned by a tech company. You should be the sole owner of the content you share online. And that’s what IndieWeb encourages people to do.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/07/indiewebify-me-and-dont-forget-my-webmentions/#how-does-it-work\">\n      Link</a>How does it work?\n</h2><p>Alright, from here on, I’ll be outlining which steps I took, to make my website ready for the IndieWeb.</p>\n<p>I already owned a domain and space to host a site, so that’s a given, though I wasn’t aware of it being an actual requirement to “become a citizen of the IndieWeb”. I first stumbled upon <strong>Amit Gawande</strong>’s post \n<a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2018/02/10/204300.html\" title=\"IndieWebify Your Hugo Website\">IndieWebify Your Hugo Website</a>\n, because this site is also generated using Hugo. I actually \n<a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/02/chringel-hugo-theme/\" title=\"wrote the theme myself\">wrote the theme myself</a>\n, so making changes to it’s markup wouldn’t be a problem.</p>\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"https://chringel.dev/2022/07/indiewebify-me-and-dont-forget-my-webmentions/#1-set-up-web-sign-in\">\n      Link</a>1. Set up Web Sign In\n</h3><p>In order to authenticate yourself as the owner of your website using your domain, you will need to set up means to sign in via \n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth\" title=\"IndieAuth\">IndieAuth</a>\n. That means you use your domain to verify yourself as the owner of your other social profiles.</p>\n<p>Just add a <code>rel=me</code> \n<a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\" title=\"microformat\">microformat</a>\n to all your links leading to your profiles on other platforms. That’s actually the first thing I changed and made a \n<a href=\"https://github.com/chringel21/chringel-hugo-theme/commit/0996a9116fd40ba0c283a3164349828df9e78952#diff-96762550561f76f989ced99c4a0751e94696682490ee94b2d77a66377c9619eb\" title=\"commit\">commit</a>\n for.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint: All code excerpts are reduced to a minimal working example.</strong></p>\n<pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code>&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">div</span>&gt;\n  {{ range .Site.Menus.social }}\n  &lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">a</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"me\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"{{ .URL }}\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">title</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"{{ .Name }}\"</span>&gt; {{ .Name }} &lt;/<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">a</span>&gt;\n  {{ end }}\n&lt;/<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">div</span>&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Next, \n<a href=\"https://github.com/chringel21/chringel-hugo-theme/commit/c4221beea4a79c874a788d544cb32fadba919ebc\" title=\"I added an authorization endpoint\">I added an authorization endpoint</a>\n to validate my identity.

        "text": "I actually can’t recall anymore, what got me started with this whole IndieWeb thing. According to my browser history, I visited \nIndieWeb.org\n on June 15, 2022, so around a month ago. I read up on Miriam Suzanne’s hugely popular post \nAm I on the IndieWeb Yet?\n and searched Google for “hugo indieweb” in the hopes there was some kind of \nrecipe\n to get me started on my static page (I’m a developer and after all *let’s say it all together* developers are lazy).\nThere wasn’t THE ONE answer I was hoping for, but instead lot’s and lot’s of blog posts by people describing their way of getting into the IndieWeb. I was overwhelmed and intrigued at the same time, so I let it rest for a couple of days - four, to be exact. The afternoon of June 20, 2022, I went deep, even deeper than \nJamiroquai\n, into the rabbit hole that is The IndieWeb. Let’s retrace my steps through said browser history and commits.\n\n  \n      LinkWhat’s IndieWeb?\n\nThe IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. - \nIndieWeb.org\n\n\nThat’s what it says on the cover. It’s about owning your content, sharing your thoughts and ideas in one place and then syndicating it to other (social) platforms. What if Twitter, for example, will be bought by a stupidly rich philanthropist who decides to shut it down? Where will all your tweets go?\nIn my opinion, your Twitter or your Facebook profile should not be your digital identity, owned by a tech company. You should be the sole owner of the content you share online. And that’s what IndieWeb encourages people to do.\n\n  \n      LinkHow does it work?\nAlright, from here on, I’ll be outlining which steps I took, to make my website ready for the IndieWeb.\nI already owned a domain and space to host a site, so that’s a given, though I wasn’t aware of it being an actual requirement to “become a citizen of the IndieWeb”. I first stumbled upon Amit Gawande’s post \nIndieWebify Your Hugo Website\n, because this site is also generated using Hugo. I actually \nwrote the theme myself\n, so making changes to it’s markup wouldn’t be a problem.\n\n  \n      Link1. Set up Web Sign In\nIn order to authenticate yourself as the owner of your website using your domain, you will need to set up means to sign in via \nIndieAuth\n. That means you use your domain to verify yourself as the owner of your other social profiles.\nJust add a rel=me \nmicroformat\n to all your links leading to your profiles on other platforms. That’s actually the first thing I changed and made a \ncommit\n for.\nHint: All code excerpts are reduced to a minimal working example.\n<div>\n  {{ range .Site.Menus.social }}\n  <a rel=\"me\" href=\"{{ .URL }}\" title=\"{{ .Name }}\"> {{ .Name }} </a>\n  {{ end }}\n</div>\nNext, \nI added an authorization endpoint\n to validate my identity. There are different services, but \nIndieAuth.com\n seems to be the go to solution.\n\n{{ with .Site.Params.indieweb }}\n  <link\n    rel=\"authorization_endpoint\"\n    href=\"{{ .authorizationEndpoint | default \"https://indieauth.com/auth\" }}\"\n  />\n  <link\n    rel=\"token_endpoint\"\n    href=\"{{ .tokenEndpoint | default \"https://tokens.indieauth.com/token\" }}\"\n  />\n{{ end }}\nI also read about it on Ana Ulin’s post \nUsing Your Site As Your Login\n. I went back to her \nposts about IndieWeb\n a couple of times during my journey.\n\n  \n      Link2. Add author markup\nNext step was to actually provide some basic information about myself, on my website. Sure, I already had an \nAbout page\n, but that’s not machine readable. The h-card \nmicroformat\n provides properties that can be parsed. \nHere’s the commit\n.\n\n<div class=\"h-card\">\n  <p>\n    <a class=\"u-url\" href=\"{{ .Site.BaseURL }}\">{{ .Site.Title }}</a>\n    {{ with .Site.Params.Hcard.Avatar }}\n      <img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"\" src=\"{{ . | absURL }}\" />\n    {{ end }}\n    <span class=\"p-name\" rel=\"me\">\n      {{ .Site.Params.Hcard.FullName }}\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  {{ with .Site.Params.Hcard.Biography }}\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"p-note\">{{ . | markdownify }}</span>\n    </p>\n  {{ end }}\n</div>\nAgain, this is a minimal example. There are many more properties that can be added. This is where I found \nIndieWebify.me\n, a nice guide to check whether your site is ready for the IndieWeb.\n\n  \n      \n        Valid h-card entry parsed by IndieWebify.me\n      \n    \n  \n      Link3. Add content markup\nIf you want to publish content on the IndieWeb, it has to be machine readable as well. I added more markup, this time to my post templates. That’s the h-entry \nmicroformat\n. IndieWebify.me was a huge helper for this step. A \ncouple\n \nof\n \ncommits\n and \niterations\n later, my content was recognized correctly.\nIn this example, I add the following h-entry properties:\n\np-name - the post’s title\n\ne-content - the post’s content\n\np-author - who wrote the post\n\ndt-published - when the post was published\n\nu-url - the permalink to the post\n\np-category - categories or tags for the post\n{{ define \"main\" }}\n  <article class=\"h-entry\">\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">{{ .Title }}</h1>\n    <p class=\"e-content\">{{ .Content }}</p>\n    <div>\n      <span>Posted By:</span>\n      <a rel=\"author\" class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"{{ \"about\" | relURL }}\">\n        {{ .Params.author }}\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pb-2\">\n      <span>Posted:</span>\n      <time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .PublishDate.Format \"January 2, 2006\" }}\">\n        <a class=\"u-url\" href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ $publishDate }}</a>\n      </time>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pb-2\">\n      <span>Categories:</span>\n      {{ range $idx, $category := . }}\n        {{- if ne $idx 0 }}{{ end }}\n        <a class=\"p-category\" href=\"{{ \"categories/\" | relURL }}{{ $category | urlize }}\">\n          {{ $category }}\n        </a>\n      {{- end }}\n    </div>\n  </article>\n{{ end }}\n\n  \n      \n        Valid h-card parsed by IndieWebify.me\n      \n    At this point, my content is correctly marked up to be consumed by the IndieWeb. This was all relatively easy. The next step was a little bit more challenging, because it meant working on the backend.\n\n  \n      Link4. Add Webmentions\nAfter I read Fundor 333’s post \nHow I implement Indieweb, Webmention and H Entry in My Blog\n I was wondering: What are Webmentions?\n\nWebmentions\n are a W3C recommendation for conversations and interactions across websites.

Vanishingly little Webmention spam has been seen in the wild. <br /><br />\nRemoving the pingback link from the header of that particular page (or others that might get linked to with heavily trafficked sites like CSS-Tricks which are often pirated) should solve your immediate problem. Hopefully those who are working on additional anti-spam features will add to these measures to further mitigate this sort of issue for the broader publics' use and adoption. I've personally experienced this sort of \"attack\" at least once in the pingback space and another using the even older refbacks specification.

      "content": {
        "html": "<p>Reading Miriam Suzanne’s <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">excellent article</a> on the complexity of implementing Webmentions got me thinking about the IndieWeb again. I stepped away from social media a while back, but the one thing I’ve consistently missed is having a way to record all the little moments that make up who I am. Since I’m on break from classes and teaching, I decided to challenge myself by adding Webmentions to my own site and documenting the process. Hopefully it’ll help someone else out!</p><h2>Step one: Choose a tech stack</h2><p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/de-mystifying-indieweb-on-a-wordpress-site/\">I’m told this is a lot easier if you use WordPress or a CMS</a>. That said, despite WordPress being my day-job-specialty, the last evidence of WordPress on my personal site is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161010003336/http://lastletterdesign.com/\">over here on archive.org</a>. So here we are: the tough road. I promise it’s not as tough as it looks.</p><p>These days (and by these days, I really mean “a decision I made six years ago that I haven’t had time to change yet”), I use <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> to generate a static site. I didn’t want to redesign my entire website to try out Webmentions, so I chose a few online services that paired nicely with my setup. Tech stacks are always a negotiation between personal preference, your current knowledge, how much rework you want to do, and in my case, the path of least pain. I feel very at home with HTML, CSS, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a>, and GitHub Actions, so my tech stack is based around those:</p><ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> (for site generation)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/\">Netlify CMS</a> (for content management)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://indielogin.com/\">IndieLogin</a> (for login)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> (for syndication)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> (for hosting - <a href=\"https://cnly.github.io/2018/04/14/just-3-steps-adding-netlify-cms-to-existing-github-pages-site-within-10-minutes.html\">this</a> is how I added Netlify CMS)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub Actions</a> (for deployment)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> (for receiving and testing receiving)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://webmention.app/\">Webmention.app</a> (for sending)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://webmention.rocks/\">Webmention.rocks</a> (for testing sending)</li>\n</ul><p>If you’re on a static site generator, great! Keep reading, and swap out your generator, hosting, and deploy technologies as needed. The bones of this setup will still be helpful to you.</p><h2>Step two: Add IndieLogin</h2><p>Logging into <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> is super easy - just use your URL! - <em>if</em> you have IndieLogin set up. Fortunately, it’s super easy to <a href=\"https://indielogin.com/setup\">set up your site to work with IndieLogin</a>. Just add <code>rel=\"me\"</code> to your social media links, and you’ll be able to authenticate with your existing social media services.</p><h2>Step three: Connect Webmention.io to your site</h2><p>When you log in, you’ll find a settings page with some code somewhat like this, but specific to your username:</p><pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span><span>&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"webmention\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"https://webmention.io/username/webmention\"</span> /&gt;\n</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span style=\"color:#f92672;\">link</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">rel</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"pingback\"</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e;\">href</span><span style=\"color:#f92672;\">=</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74;\">\"https://webmention.io/username/xmlrpc\"</span> /&gt;\n</span></span></code></pre><p>I added my personalized version of that code into the head tag of my website.</p><h2>Step four: Test that a Webmention elsewhere shows for you</h2><p>Luckily, <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> comes with a handy dandy form at the endpoint for you to test this with. Head on over to your personalized Webmention link from above, and you’ll see a simple form to send a happy little mention on over to yourself, Bob Ross-style.</p><p>The source URL will be a page that mentions something about you, and the target URL will be the page that the Webmention should be associated with. Perhaps you already have a mention out there you’re aware of. If you are me, you don’t because you deleted all your social media and most people didn’t know you existed in the first place, making this without question the most difficult part of the entire IndieWeb implementation process.</p><p>I digress.</p><p>In these cases, perhaps it’s clearest to <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/learning-to-love-hugo/\">just Webmention yourself</a>. I wanted <a href=\"https://github.com/voxpelli/node-webmention-testpinger\">node-webmention-testpinger</a> to work so badly, but I couldn’t get it to work like I expected. Let me know if you can get it to work and how, because I love the variety of formats it tests.</p><p>In my case, the source was this post’s URL, and the target was <code>https://ashleykolodziej.com/learning-to-love-hugo/</code>. After you submit the form and see a “pending” message, give it a refresh. With luck, you’ll see it change to “Success”!</p><p>Head back on over to your dashboard at <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/add-webmentions-to-static-site/webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a>, and you’ll see a brandy-new Webmention.</p><h2>Step five: Add microformat classes to your content</h2><p>I noticed many posts stop right around getting other people’s Webmentions to your website, which sure seems like the type of thing you could get away with doing if people knew about you. If, like me, your problems are more centered around people <em>not</em> knowing about you, adding the ability to send Webmentions is one way to fix that. And to do that, we need to do some markup work so the right data is going out with these mentions.</p><p>First, identify the type of content you’re likely to create a Webmention with, and then take a look at the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page#Specifications\">Microformats specification</a> to see which microformat matches best. In my case, it’s a blog post, so I chose to use the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry\">h-entry microformat</a>. After taking a look at my markup, I needed to add an <code>h-entry</code> class around my entire blog post, a <code>p-name</code> class to my title, a <code>p-author</code> to show that I am (indeed) the author of the post, an <code>h-card</code> which talks a bit more about me (I’ll expand on that in a moment), a <code>u-url</code> class as well as my permalink, and a <code>dt-published</code> class.</p><h2>Step six: Add an h-card</h2><p>An h-card lets the web know (programmatically) who you are as a person. This standardized markup is what allows other websites using Webmentions to show your name and avatar next to mentions or comments.

Since I’m using Hugo, I followed <a href=\"https://digitaldrummerj.me/hugo-create-rss-feed/\">Justin James’s excellent instructions</a> to add an RSS feed template to my Hugo theme. Adding the default template will enable a feed for every content type, <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/index.xml\">like so</a>, and it will also automatically enable feeds based on a category, such as <a href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/categories/design/index.xml\">this site’s design RSS feed</a>. Right now, I don’t have images in the feed. I’ll add images to my RSS feed later, since I don’t need that to test Webmentions.</p><h2>Step nine: Set up automatic Webmentions notifications</h2><p>A good next step is to test that your new Webmentions functionality shows up properly for someone else. I took inspiration from <a href=\"https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-10-13-sending-webmentions-from-a-static-website\">James Mead’s awesome instructions</a> to do this with <a href=\"https://webmention.app/\">https://webmention.app/</a>.</p><p>In his instructions, James abstracted the sending script to <a href=\"https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions\">its own GitHub repo</a> and watched for changes to the RSS feed. But since I’m already <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action\">building Hugo with a GitHub Action to host on GitHub Pages</a>, I know exactly when my RSS feed has been rebuilt, and it’s at the end of my action. That’s the approach I’m going to take here.</p><p>First, install the webmention.app CLI by running <code>npm install @remy/webmention --save-dev</code> in your project’s folder. I used this to test Webmentions locally before adding them to the GitHub action.</p><p>Then, run <code>npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --debug</code> using your RSS feed URL to see if your latest post has a valid webmention without actually sending it. Once you’ve verified you have valid Webmentions to send out, you can add the CLI command to your GitHub Actions script.</p><p>The action itself is very simple—just add the same commands you’d run locally. Don’t forget to switch out the URL if you’re an avid copy/paster like I am.</p><pre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span><span>- <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">name</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">Install Dependencies</span>\n</span></span><span><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">run</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">npm install</span>\n</span></span><span><span>- <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">name</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">Test Webmentions</span>\n</span></span><span><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672;\">run</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff;\">npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --send</span>\n</span></span></code></pre><h2>Step ten: Test that your Webmention shows elsewhere</h2><p>To test if the Webmention actually shows on test content, I used <a href=\"https://webmention.rocks\">https://webmention.rocks</a>. Each of the links on their homepage tests a different type of HTML that could be used to create a Webmention. I used Test 1 to find out if my test post correctly sent a Webmention through Webmention.io. It went through completely smoothly and without a hitch right away.</p><p>Kidding.</p><p>Realistically, this took me several tries to figure out. My advice is to take a close look at your microformats, and use the <a href=\"https://pin13.net/mf2/\">pin13 microformats parser</a> to help with debugging. One thing I found out as a result of this is that it looks like Webmentions don’t duplicate if you push them out multiple times using webmention.app—they just update.</p><h2>Bonus time: Add support to Hugo for inline attributes</h2><p>If you want to add classes to your Markdown, you can update <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#goldmark\">Hugo’s Markdown renderer, Goldmark</a>, to do that. Set <code>block</code> to <code>true</code>, and then add your attributes or classes to any block you like in your Markdown. I’m considering using this to add <code>h-cite</code> and <code>u-in-reply-to</code> classes to <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/in-reply-to\">add context around my mentions</a> where it makes sense, such as where I’m extending an idea. My thinking is this is generally similar to displaying a tweet. I don’t know if this is actually a good idea since this is my first time trying this out, though. If you’ve got any thoughts on that, let me know.</p><h2>But wait, Webmentions aren’t showing on this site yet!</h2><p>That’s absolutely right! I’m not at the point where I am actually showing the data for Webmentions on my site yet. That’s because Webmentions can cover a myrid of types of interactions you might take on a social media site. Liking, retweeting, bookmarking, citing, referencing, replying, commenting… the list goes on, and the data can too. Some of these deserve a slightly different user interface treatment, and I don’t know what that is for me yet. I do know it deserves its own post, and from here, you can choose how your mentions show on your website. Happy mentioning!</p>",
        "text": "Reading Miriam Suzanne’s excellent article on the complexity of implementing Webmentions got me thinking about the IndieWeb again. I stepped away from social media a while back, but the one thing I’ve consistently missed is having a way to record all the little moments that make up who I am. Since I’m on break from classes and teaching, I decided to challenge myself by adding Webmentions to my own site and documenting the process. Hopefully it’ll help someone else out!Step one: Choose a tech stackI’m told this is a lot easier if you use WordPress or a CMS. That said, despite WordPress being my day-job-specialty, the last evidence of WordPress on my personal site is over here on archive.org. So here we are: the tough road. I promise it’s not as tough as it looks.These days (and by these days, I really mean “a decision I made six years ago that I haven’t had time to change yet”), I use Hugo to generate a static site. I didn’t want to redesign my entire website to try out Webmentions, so I chose a few online services that paired nicely with my setup. Tech stacks are always a negotiation between personal preference, your current knowledge, how much rework you want to do, and in my case, the path of least pain. I feel very at home with HTML, CSS, npm, and GitHub Actions, so my tech stack is based around those:\nHugo (for site generation)\n\nNetlify CMS (for content management)\n\nIndieLogin (for login)\n\nRSS (for syndication)\n\nGitHub Pages (for hosting - this is how I added Netlify CMS)\n\nGitHub Actions (for deployment)\n\nWebmention.io (for receiving and testing receiving)\n\nWebmention.app (for sending)\n\nWebmention.rocks (for testing sending)\nIf you’re on a static site generator, great! Keep reading, and swap out your generator, hosting, and deploy technologies as needed. The bones of this setup will still be helpful to you.Step two: Add IndieLoginLogging into Webmention.io is super easy - just use your URL! - if you have IndieLogin set up. Fortunately, it’s super easy to set up your site to work with IndieLogin. Just add rel=\"me\" to your social media links, and you’ll be able to authenticate with your existing social media services.Step three: Connect Webmention.io to your siteWhen you log in, you’ll find a settings page with some code somewhat like this, but specific to your username:<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/username/webmention\" />\n<link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"https://webmention.io/username/xmlrpc\" />\nI added my personalized version of that code into the head tag of my website.Step four: Test that a Webmention elsewhere shows for youLuckily, Webmention.io comes with a handy dandy form at the endpoint for you to test this with. Head on over to your personalized Webmention link from above, and you’ll see a simple form to send a happy little mention on over to yourself, Bob Ross-style.The source URL will be a page that mentions something about you, and the target URL will be the page that the Webmention should be associated with. Perhaps you already have a mention out there you’re aware of. If you are me, you don’t because you deleted all your social media and most people didn’t know you existed in the first place, making this without question the most difficult part of the entire IndieWeb implementation process.I digress.In these cases, perhaps it’s clearest to just Webmention yourself. I wanted node-webmention-testpinger to work so badly, but I couldn’t get it to work like I expected. Let me know if you can get it to work and how, because I love the variety of formats it tests.In my case, the source was this post’s URL, and the target was https://ashleykolodziej.com/learning-to-love-hugo/. After you submit the form and see a “pending” message, give it a refresh. With luck, you’ll see it change to “Success”!Head back on over to your dashboard at Webmention.io, and you’ll see a brandy-new Webmention.Step five: Add microformat classes to your contentI noticed many posts stop right around getting other people’s Webmentions to your website, which sure seems like the type of thing you could get away with doing if people knew about you. If, like me, your problems are more centered around people not knowing about you, adding the ability to send Webmentions is one way to fix that. And to do that, we need to do some markup work so the right data is going out with these mentions.First, identify the type of content you’re likely to create a Webmention with, and then take a look at the Microformats specification to see which microformat matches best. In my case, it’s a blog post, so I chose to use the h-entry microformat. After taking a look at my markup, I needed to add an h-entry class around my entire blog post, a p-name class to my title, a p-author to show that I am (indeed) the author of the post, an h-card which talks a bit more about me (I’ll expand on that in a moment), a u-url class as well as my permalink, and a dt-published class.Step six: Add an h-cardAn h-card lets the web know (programmatically) who you are as a person. This standardized markup is what allows other websites using Webmentions to show your name and avatar next to mentions or comments. I used MDN’s excellent h-card example as a starting point for a card to add my own to the bottom of all my posts. It’s pretty simple to build and modify—just add any h-card supported property as a class to your HTML, and other IndieWeb users will get a nicely structured JSON object about you and who you are when you send a Webmention.I chose to leave out the physical address and keep my email discoverable, and add a rel=\"author\" attribute since I use this website to write articles. I also followed Aaron Parecki’s lead regarding bios by using the p-note class to wrap around my entire bio.I was curious if the parser would pick up any data that is generally structured with these types of classes, so I added a p-pronouns class, which isn’t officially supported, to see if it would.<aside class=\"p-author h-card\">\n    <h2>About the author</h2>\n    <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com/img/profile.jpg\" \n    alt=\"A white woman with with glasses and long, curled blonde hair at a \n    park, wearing a colorful dress and smiling.\" />\n    <p class=\"p-note\">\n        <a rel=\"author\" class=\"p-name u-url\" \n        href=\"https://ashleykolodziej.com\">Ashley Kolodziej</a> \n        (<span class=\"p-pronouns\">she/her/hers</span>) is an \n        <span class=\"p-job-title\">Associate Creative Director</span> in \n        <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/interactive-design/\" class=\"p-org\">\n        Boston University's Interactive Design department</a>.

You can reach her at <a class=\"u-email\" href=\"\n        mailto:ashley@lastletterdesign.com\">ashley@lastletterdesign.com</a>.\n    </p>\n</aside>\nStep seven: Test your h-cardThe pin13 microformats parser lets you test either a live URL or the HTML. When I tested this blog post, I was excited to see that I was right—my pronouns were listed among the properties!It’s up to the folks who implement webmentions on their websites what they want to do with the data from here, and as always, you should check if something existing can be used in the spec to mark up your data.

Since I’m using Hugo, I followed Justin James’s excellent instructions to add an RSS feed template to my Hugo theme. Adding the default template will enable a feed for every content type, like so, and it will also automatically enable feeds based on a category, such as this site’s design RSS feed. Right now, I don’t have images in the feed. I’ll add images to my RSS feed later, since I don’t need that to test Webmentions.Step nine: Set up automatic Webmentions notificationsA good next step is to test that your new Webmentions functionality shows up properly for someone else. I took inspiration from James Mead’s awesome instructions to do this with https://webmention.app/.In his instructions, James abstracted the sending script to its own GitHub repo and watched for changes to the RSS feed. But since I’m already building Hugo with a GitHub Action to host on GitHub Pages, I know exactly when my RSS feed has been rebuilt, and it’s at the end of my action. That’s the approach I’m going to take here.First, install the webmention.app CLI by running npm install @remy/webmention --save-dev in your project’s folder. I used this to test Webmentions locally before adding them to the GitHub action.Then, run npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --debug using your RSS feed URL to see if your latest post has a valid webmention without actually sending it. Once you’ve verified you have valid Webmentions to send out, you can add the CLI command to your GitHub Actions script.The action itself is very simple—just add the same commands you’d run locally. Don’t forget to switch out the URL if you’re an avid copy/paster like I am.- name: Install Dependencies\n  run: npm install\n- name: Test Webmentions\n  run: npx webmention https://your-rss-link-here.xml --limit 1 --send\nStep ten: Test that your Webmention shows elsewhereTo test if the Webmention actually shows on test content, I used https://webmention.rocks. Each of the links on their homepage tests a different type of HTML that could be used to create a Webmention. I used Test 1 to find out if my test post correctly sent a Webmention through Webmention.io. It went through completely smoothly and without a hitch right away.Kidding.Realistically, this took me several tries to figure out. My advice is to take a close look at your microformats, and use the pin13 microformats parser to help with debugging. One thing I found out as a result of this is that it looks like Webmentions don’t duplicate if you push them out multiple times using webmention.app—they just update.Bonus time: Add support to Hugo for inline attributesIf you want to add classes to your Markdown, you can update Hugo’s Markdown renderer, Goldmark, to do that. Set block to true, and then add your attributes or classes to any block you like in your Markdown. I’m considering using this to add h-cite and u-in-reply-to classes to add context around my mentions where it makes sense, such as where I’m extending an idea. My thinking is this is generally similar to displaying a tweet. I don’t know if this is actually a good idea since this is my first time trying this out, though. If you’ve got any thoughts on that, let me know.But wait, Webmentions aren’t showing on this site yet!That’s absolutely right! I’m not at the point where I am actually showing the data for Webmentions on my site yet. That’s because Webmentions can cover a myrid of types of interactions you might take on a social media site. Liking, retweeting, bookmarking, citing, referencing, replying, commenting… the list goes on, and the data can too. Some of these deserve a slightly different user interface treatment, and I don’t know what that is for me yet. I do know it deserves its own post, and from here, you can choose how your mentions show on your website. Happy mentioning!"
