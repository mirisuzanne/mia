      Herman is my documentation dream come true,
      especially when it comes to systems design.

summary: |
  Design systems streamline development,
  communication, and consistency --
  but often rely on dedicated
  teams and extended budgets.

We wanted a tool that helps create and maintain
living style guides & pattern libraries in an
agile process, and on a budget.
Herman helps you keep your development process simple --
and your UX consistent --
as you iterate on patterns and scale over time.
