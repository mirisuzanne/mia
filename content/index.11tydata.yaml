  This is not what I had in mind.
  I thought my website would be way cooler than this.
  I wanted to make something like
  the [1996 SpaceJam website](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.html),
  but about me instead.
  Maybe I should add more stars in the background.
  How many background stars is the right number of background stars?

  Someone told me that my home page
  should always be selling something.
  _To be blunt,
  no one who lands on your personal site
  got there because they care about you personally._
  I'm sorry to hear that,
  but here are
  [some things you can buy](https://miriamsuzanne.square.site/).

  The following website has been modified
  from its original version.
  It has been formatted to fit this screen.

  For this performance of my website,
  the role of Miriam
  will be played by an understudy.
  Thank you for your patience and understanding.

  The origin of the name Miriam isn't known for certain,
  but there are several theories,
  including _sea of bitterness_,
  or _beloved_, or _wished-for child_.

  You can make a web
  that's _world wide_
  by saying
  _it works on my machine,
  and everyone else is an edge-case_.

  We are not here to flatter egotism,
  or prop up humbug;
  we are merely telling the story.
  We value what is good in [the web];
  but we believe in the existence of other,
  and more vivid kinds of goodness.
