summary: |
  I studied theater, writing, and visual art
  at Goshen College --
  but never took those 2 final classes
  required for graduation.
---

I also worked for several years
as the Master Electrician of performance venues --
including both the Umble Center theater,
and then-new Music Center concert halls.
