Last week,
my dad sent me a newspaper ==clipping==
from the Gary (Indiana) Post-Tribune --
December 20, 1999.
There's ==a photo== of me at 17,
a senior in high school,
leaning against a mountain bike.
I'm wearing baggy jeans,
socks,
and Birkenstock.
Because it's the 90s
and I'm into fashion.

To quote the caption,
I ==had been== *living rustically* since September,
when I moved into ==a small== cabin
at the edge of my parents farm,
along the Elkhart River.
*An ==experiment== in simple living*
according to the article.
That’s true.
I had a hand pump over the sink,
a wood stove for heat,
an outhouse,
some oil lamps,
==and a typewriter== for my homework.

I read a lot of Thích Nhất Hạnh in that cabin,
and wrote ==some truly mediocre== poetry.
What a writer ==friend== referred to recently as
*poemy poems, about stones*.

The article also ==says I had==
*==aspirations towards== a monastic life after high school*.
I don’t remember serious monastic plans exactly,
but now I'm a software developer,
and a musician living in a loft
just off South Broadway.
It’s not rustic or monastic.
When I want to write ==mediocre poetry now,==
I walk down to the Bardo coffee house
and listen to ==Lizzo== on my Airpods.
What happened?

Here's the headline from the article:
*Teen son lives like Thoreau, says dad*.

*Teen son*.
I couldn't read the rest of the article.
I went back to watching Project Runway.
==I don’t want to spoil== anything,
but Bishme is great,
and Garo’s a total hack.

So I've been thinking a lot about change.
{{ content.erase('Big change') }}.
Identity change.
I was raised Mennonite,
but at some point that label stopped making sense.
I was raised a boy, too,
but that didn't stick.
I was also married, once --
that’s another story.
But I remember talking to my aunt during the divorce.
This was 2004, maybe 2005.
We're sitting ==around her kitchen table== late at night,
and she says
*You can start dating again
once your ex doesn't come up in daily conversation --
once the stories you tell don't involve her.*

==It's not a perfect== rule --
date whenever you want to --
but I still love something about that:
using our internal narrative as a guide.
Not in some spiritual sense, but very practically.
My ==identity== is a story that I tell to myself,
and to you,
and I can change the way I tell that story,
but it takes time to write that new material.
Or to *live* that new material.

==In this case,==
material without my ex wife --
which is awkward,
‘cause here I am 15 years later,
standing on stage,
talking about her.

Sorry Erin!
I guess ==I’m not ready== to date yet!

But back then,
living in that small community,
small Mennonite college town,
everyone knows me --
knows us.
Everyone needs ==to hear the story,==
so I tell it over and over ==for months.==
And it’s clear,
every time,
that ==I’m being cross-examined.==
I've done something bad,
and I have to defend my actions.
==And== I can do that.
I can tell that story,
but it feels gross.

Why do ==I need to== explain myself to you?
*It was bad and I left.
Trust me.*

And I ==think about== smaller changes, too.
I remember moving to Denver --
driving in on 76 for the first time.
This is August 2007 now,
and I remember ==the sun== setting over the mountains due west,
and storm clouds rolling in from the southwest --
lightning ==flashing behind a city== skyline.

The scale of it!
The expanse.
To see that storm *from a distance*,
between a skyline and a mountain range.
==That’s not a thing== in Indiana.
It feels like space and possibility.
So much room for something new.
So much more to the world than *right here* or *right now* or *just me*.
It felt like home.
==Driving home.==
A home I'd never been to?

I would sometimes walk down 16th street at night
just to feel invisible -- part of a crowd.
==Someone else might== frame this
as a move from the peaceful woods
to the bustling city,
but my ==experience== was the opposite.
==Being *unknown*== gave me room to think,
and space to change --
emotional space the cabin couldn't provide.

And then I would meet people,
and they’d ask where I'm from,
and they’d mean *before Denver*,
and I guess Indiana?
==But it felt== wrong, like the wrong question.
Not because Indiana is bad --
this was before Mike Pence --
but because, I don’t know,
I was ==eager for my narrative== home
to catch up with my experience ==of home.==

And a year later
I was on the road back through the Midwest,
touring a theater production with new friends.
==And every night,==
after the show,
audience members would ask where we came from.
I was so happy.
*I'm from Denver!*
I mean, it’s super silly --
==this gentrified mess of a city==.
Shrooms are legal, but being homeless is a crime.

Still, at that point, I guess:
home ==is important.==
It gives your story context.
The frame matches the content.

But what happens to that old story
when the new one comes along?
Suddenly we’re correcting everyone.
I’m not Mennonite anymore.
==I’m not married.==
I’m not a boy.
*You're thinking of Yesterday Me!
Yester-me!
She’s a whole different person!*
And ==again,== coming out --
this is 2015 now --
I’m asked to explain and defend my actions.

*It was bad, and I left. Trust me.*
This frame matches the content.

And the story we expect to hear --
want to hear --
is that *born-this-way* narrative.
*Trapped in the wrong body*,
whatever that means.
==This body== is mine.
It just needed some estrogen up in there,
that’s all.
Anyway, I remember being that boy in that cabin,
talking to the South Bend Post-Tribune
about simple living and monastic life.
I was that titular teen son.

But I do also remember --
all along --
how much I *wasn't a boy*
when I ==lived in that cabin,==
and talked to that reporter.
I mean, obviously:
it was *me* in the cabin,
and I’m *not a boy*.
We grow.
We change.
We have ==to tell a new story,==
and bring people along.
We have to get our stories ==straight.==

Not ==straight, straight,== but ==straight.== You know.

I wasn't *born this way*,
I grew into it --
like ==every child== grows into their adult narrative.
I chose it.
I looked at my options,
and ==chose estrogen,
and== I’m proud of that choice.
It’s ok to have choice.
Choice is a good thing.
==I’m tired of== the narrative that my queerness is ok
as long as I didn’t want it.
I wanted estrogen, and I got it.
If you want estrogen,
==you== can have it ==too.==

All of that is true, and also.
Also I *was* born with *all of this* inside of me.
Born to grow into this desire, this choice.
*Born to choose this way.*
Because biology and choice aren’t at odds,
they’re both part of life -- being alive.
==Life isn’t== static, it moves and changes.
As it moves, we tell new stories.
We take ==a snapshot,==
we add ==a caption,==
and we publish it in the Gary Post-Tribune.
==One moment in== time.
One boy who’s also ==a girl.==
One boy who will grow into a woman.

Anyway,
I got Erin to read the article out-loud to me --
translate it so ==I could hear myself== in the story.
"Teen *daughter* lives like Thoreau, says dad.
*Miriam* needs space and quiet,
and *she’s* got that now."
And it's interesting to read that --
or hear it --
knowing what I know:
about myself,
about my loud father,
about being introverted,
and an activist,
a writer,
caring about the world --
what I’ve done with those feelings,
those beliefs.
==Not letting them go,==
but letting them grow with me,
to become who I am now.

And, well yester-me, fuck.
The world hasn’t gotten better.
Shit’s bad, and you’ll have to keep fighting.
But ==you’ll be glad to know:==
==you get to be== a girl,
you love it,
you’re not from Indiana anymore,
and you finally --
after ==many failed u-haul-lesbian== relationships --
you finally live on your own,
not entirely monastic,
surrounded by ==friends,==
with a wonderful partner just down the hall.

If I'm still allowed to date ==after this.==
