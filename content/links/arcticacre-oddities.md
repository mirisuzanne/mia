In case you are ever bored,
there are some things you should be doing
on the internet.
Several of those things were made by
[Jason Nelson](https://www.secrettechnology.com/).

You might start with the games
("i made this, you play this, we are enemies" shown above),
then perhaps some
"[Stunningly Harmful Songs](https://www.secrettechnology.com/songs/harmsong1.html)...
for spreading and baffling and loving."
You can explore on your own from there.
