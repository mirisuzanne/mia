summary: |
  I'm a sucker for a good
  personal site redesign,
  especially when it comes with
  an attached blog post.

I especially like that the post
shows how the old design looked.

Both the before and after pics
show inspiring, fun designs.
Both designs represent Melanie's interests
in beautiful visual clues --
from computers to quilting.
It makes the designs feel personal.
