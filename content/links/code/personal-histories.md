  How would our words change
  if we were writing for someone in crisis?
  Would our language soften?
  Would we ask for less?

If you don't know Sara's work,
go read a copy of
[Technically Wrong](https://www.sarawb.com/books) --
one of the best tech books I've read.

_Personal Histories_
is an older post on a similar topic,
linked in the web archive,
but still worth your time --
a reminder that the personal questions we ask
in a web interface are _personal questions_:

> _How many children do you have?_
> might sound like the simplest question,
> until it brings a grieving parent to their knees.
> _When is your anniversary?_
> might create a moment of pause for someone who’s recently separated.
> Even _What’s your hometown?_
> or _Where did you go on vacation as a child?_
> might feel painful for kids who grew up
> without that kind of stability or privilege.

At the end of the post
Sara suggests a few principles
for form design.
I was particularly struck by
principle #4 --
_communicate what happens next_.

I recently bought a membership
for Denver Parks & Recreation facilities.
The registration form includes a required
'gender' select input
with the options:

- Male
- Female
- Intersex
- Transgender
- Other

There are many issues with that list,
but in the moment I needed to know:
_why are you asking, and what will you do with this info_?
If they need to know
what it says on my ID,
or what changing room I'll use,
the answer is _female_.
If they just need demographic data,
I'm happy to mark _transgender_.
Without more details,
I'm selecting the option
least likely to be used
for discrimination.
