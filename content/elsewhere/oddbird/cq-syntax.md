    Wireframe of card elements
    in different sized containers --
    some laid out vertically in small spaces,
    others horizontal when there's room.
  position: top
tags:
  - css
  - csswg
  - container queries
summary: |
  Since we got a first look at
  a Container Queries prototype
  back in April 2021,
  the syntax has changed a few times.
  But now the spec is stable,
  browsers are getting ready to ship,
  and it's time to make sure
  you're using the same syntax they are!
