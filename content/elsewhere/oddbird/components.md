    with a red and green oroboros serpent
    biting it's own tail,
    and seeming to give us side-eye

  There’s been a recent flurry
  of articles about web components,
  with advice on how to shape them as extensions of HTML.
  I decided to dig in,
  and see how these ‘HTML web components’
  could become a part of my own workflow.
