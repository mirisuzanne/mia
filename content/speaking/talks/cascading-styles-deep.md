  Itâ€™s a great time to revisit
  everything you thought you knew about CSS.
  Join Miriam for a deep dive
  into what makes the language work,
  and how we can harness its power
  to develop resilient and delightful experiences
  that hold up across browsers, languages, and device interfaces.

A lot has changed in the nearly 30 years since CSS was first proposed,
and new features are shipping at an unprecedented rate --
cascade layers, container queries,
the ':has()' selector, wide-gamut colors,
subgrid, and so much more.

Meanwhile, we're still getting used to
custom properties and basic grids!
Taken one at a time, the list can feel overwhelming,
but these features all fit together to form a highly systemic language
based on a radical foundation: _the cascade of styles_.
