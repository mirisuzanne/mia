  New CSS proposals like Container Queries,
  Cascade Layers, Scoped Styles, and Nesting
  are all aimed at improving the way we write
  responsive components and design systems.

{% import 'content.macros.njk' as content %}

Over the last decade
Object-Oriented & Responsive design
have become the norm --
with tools like Flexbox, Grid,
intrinsic sizing, and `aspect-ratio`
giving us even more layout control.
CSS has always been designed for a responsive web,
but that goalpost can shift over time.
Join Miriam to explore how these new features
help us write more modern, encapsulated,
and responsive CSS.
