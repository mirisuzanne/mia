Over the last decade
Object-Oriented & Responsive design
have become the norm --
with tools like Flexbox, Grid,
intrinsic sizing, and `aspect-ratio`
giving us even more layout control.
CSS has always been designed for a responsive web,
but that goalpost can shift over time.
Join Miriam to explore how these new features
help us write more modern, encapsulated,
and responsive CSS.
