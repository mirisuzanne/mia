  Over the last decade,
  Responsive Web Design and Object Oriented CSS
  have grown from exciting new trends
  into the foundations of modern, component-driven web design.
  But our medium is not done evolving.

In 2018,
Jen Simmons coined this the era of "Intrinsic Web Design" --
with powerful new tools
that allow us to build entire layouts
based on the intrinsic needs of each component.

This evolution of the responsive web
is becoming more clear with several new features in CSS.
We'll look at a number of these developments,
with a special focus on Cascade Layers
(giving you control over your own cascade),
and Container Queries
(allowing components to respond to their immediate context).
Not only do these features build on
what we love most about responsive components,
but they they're designed to address
some of the biggest challenges in CSS today.
