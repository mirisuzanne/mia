  From building beautiful sites
  to maintaining complex design systems
  across multiple applications,
  CSS is the web-language of design.

Join Miriam for a deep-dive into the heart of CSS:
how it works, what makes it special,
and how we can harness it for resilient and maintainable
design systems that scale.
Rather than learning a single convention or toolkit,
you’ll learn the fundamentals that all conventions share --
how to think with CSS, and make smart decisions for your own project.

Since it was first proposed in 1994,
CSS has attempted to solve two important problems:

- How can we design with systems that keep our work
  consistent, performant, and maintainable?
- How can we design with resilience across a wide range of interfaces --
  past, present, and future?

Now we’re building full mobile and desktop-style applications on the web,
and those core CSS questions are more essential than ever.
We need systems that scale,
with resilience across an ever-growing range of bowsers and devices.
Can we write CSS that’s up to the task?

Together, we’ll explore:

- Why CSS works the way it does:
  from cascade and inheritance to normal flow and formatting contexts
- Modern and “intrinsic” web layout in-depth:
  putting flexbox, grid, floats, alignment, writing modes,
  media queries and display in context
- Moving past “browser support” to write modern and resilient CSS everywhere,
  without duplicating your efforts and driving up budgets
- CSS architectures at the foundation of every naming convention,
  from OOCSS to BEM and ITCSS and beyond
- Building meaningful and maintainable design systems with modern CSS and Sass
- Integrating documentation and cross-team communication
- What’s new in both CSS and Sass,
  and how you can get involved in where they go next
