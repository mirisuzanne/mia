summary: |
  I've spent nearly two decades
  learning, teaching, and writing CSS --
  as a founder at OddBird,
  a member of the Sass core team,
  and an Invited Expert on the CSS Working Group.
---

I'm happy to sit down with various groups when I can,
and talk about that work --
how CSS came to be and how we use it,
what it means to write cascading code,
and what the future holds
for design on the web.
