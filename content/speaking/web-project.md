A **non-technical guide**
for taking your project from concept to launch,
without ever losing sight of the goals.

**Are you looking to expand your web presence,
or develop a new application?**
We'll cover the process from start to finish â€“
the decisions you need to make
about team and technology and testing,
budget and development costs,
and how to build a user-base.
After providing an overview of the basics,
we'll open it up for questions.
What do you want to know,
from a web-product expert in the field?
