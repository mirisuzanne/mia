-ian legend

Specifically, Season 6, episode 23 --
Night at a Round Table.
Let's meet the protagonist, our hero

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.003.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Bea Arthur

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.004.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Not to be confused with Arthur the anthropomorphic aardvark

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.005.jpeg' | img | safe }}

aka anteater

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.006.jpeg' | img | safe }}

or any of the actual
four species of suborder vermilingua,
the worm tongues

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.007.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Bea grew up in the Bronx

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.008.jpeg' | img | safe }}

attending the linden school for girls

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.009.jpeg' | img | safe }}

while arthur grew up in Elwood City

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.010.jpeg' | img | safe }}

and currently attends Lakewood Elementary school

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.011.jpeg' | img | safe }}

So season 6, episode 23 --
night of the round table. here we go.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.012.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Brooklyn. Dusk. The sun sinks low on the the city that never sleeps.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.013.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Nearby Elwood City also descends into darkness

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.014.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Arthur is in bed, settling in for a night of Bionic Bunny, Special Edition.
Is it 4:30pm? Why is the sun setting so early?
Or is Arthur awake at 4:30am? We'll never know

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.015.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Because our story takes place in a sunshine state
suddenly devoid of sun.
Miami at Night.

Interior. The night is dark.
Bea Arthur, sits at a table. Not just any table. This table is round.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.018.jpeg' | img | safe }}

A round table. Have you ever seen anything like it?

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.019.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Yes, yes you have.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.020.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And so has Betty white, now sitting at the table with Bea Arthur.
What hijinx will ensue?!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.021.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Well Bea's like, Pizza Damnit, get pizza!
And this is where everything goes wrong.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.022.jpeg' | img | safe }}

One day you're like: sure, weed should be legal.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.023.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And the next thing you know, Denver is overrun by cortado-drinking

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.024.jpeg' | img | safe }}

frat bros with their swords in the air

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.025.jpeg' | img | safe }}

and a constant lodo beard-fest
in the background of your once-chill round-table sitcom.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.026.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And now these bros are like:
We already dominate the board room tables,
we should take over the round tables as well!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.027.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And they start a round-table society, no girls allowed!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.028.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Where they all wear dumb robes,
and it's like the Freemasons or some goofy shit.
Charlatans that something something something
and make a hubbub in the city!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.029.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Bea Arthur could vomit just looking at them.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.030.jpeg' | img | safe }}

So she gets on the horn with her good friend Angela,

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.031.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Writer of murders

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.032.jpeg' | img | safe }}

 And they concoct a plan.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.033.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Now, eagle eyed viewers will notice they've done all of this

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.034.jpeg' | img | safe }}

at and around several important tables.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.035.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Not square tables.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.036.jpeg' | img | safe }}

These women are round-table pioneers --
perfectionists of the form.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.037.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Bea even has a round chair to sit in. That's dedication.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.038.jpeg' | img | safe }}

But the men have built this massive table now, and they're all like:

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.039.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Look at my sword.
I got it from a stone or a lake-lady or whatever,
and I gave it a name.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.040.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Hey, look at my sword.
I named it Excalibur, and it makes me the king.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.041.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Why won't you look at my sword?
I sent you a picture of my sword,
and it's a big sword. Send nudes.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.042.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Bea has nudes, of course,
but not for you.
She doesn't care about your sword, Chad.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.043.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Oh, you don't like swords --
well look at my lance.
I have a huge lance.
Do you like my lance?
It's so big. I love it so much they call me â€”

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.044.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Gross. That's gross.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.045.jpeg' | img | safe }}

So our Hero turns to her friends, and is like

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.046.jpeg' | img | safe }}

We must be the change we wish to see in the world

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.047.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And they all move to the living room, where the table has corners!
They start a rectangle campaign!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.048.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Coffee tables!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.049.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Folding tables!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.050.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Buffet tables!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.051.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Whatever this is!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.052.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Meanwhile the men are all Purity of Essence!
And Fluoridation in the water!
And their tables get bigger and rounder

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.053.jpeg' | img | safe }}

and more religious

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.054.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And they're busy comparing sword sizes in the locker room

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.055.jpeg' | img | safe }}

while Bea, over in apt. 23, has a plan.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.056.jpeg' | img | safe }}

She was born for a moment like this.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.057.jpeg' | img | safe }}

you can't bea more than she'll be. She is Bea!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.058.jpeg' | img | safe }}

And you're just a wannabe!

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.059.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Why is she even discussing this with you?

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.060.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Now Lance guy's all butt-hurt about it,
and he charges in with his weapon erect.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.061.jpeg' | img | safe }}

But our Golden Girls aren't scared

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.062.jpeg' | img | safe }}

and Bea leads an army of Star Wars Christmas Special aliens
to defeat the creepy secret sword society

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.063.jpeg' | img | safe }}

and they construct a memorial in memory of that night!
*The night of the round table*. Never forget.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.064.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Bea Arthur delivers!

There are other legends too, of course...

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.065.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Like when she wins the spelling bee

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.066.jpeg' | img | safe }}

and makes an album for kids.
*It's alright to cry.*
I love that song.

{{ 'debate/bea/bea.067.jpeg' | img | safe }}

Happy Bea-day.
