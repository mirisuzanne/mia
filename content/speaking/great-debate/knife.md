Did you know the Swiss have an Army?
They do.
And frankly,
they're _really well well-prepared_.

For _anything_.

They know what time it is,

And they know how to open a
bottle of wine.

img: Karl

All thanks to Karl Elsener,
who basically invented knives.

You can do just about anything
with one of these --

Cut an apple, sure.

img: woman-radio

Fix a radio.

img: woman-skateboard

Carve a skateboard by hand.
Oh, and don't worry boys --

so you can get in on the action, too.

Just don't stick em up your nose.
That's not safe.

Before Karl, people sat around
with basically no attitude at all,
then he comes along --

adds a reamer to a penknife,
and boom.

Attitude.

No, Karen,
that's not an attitude,
that's a t-shirt.

Victorinox made the first _Soldier knife_ --
let's please try to be specific with our language here.
It was commissioned by the Swiss Army in 1891,
and is still considered

_essential for survival_.

But honestly,
this debate isn't about
Swiss military history,
or brilliant inventors,
it's more like --

_MacGyver's Tool Time_ vs --

_Shark-Week, Naked and Afraid_.

They do look afraid, don't they?
What's in the box?

Oh fuck!

Anyway,
let's talk about this 'debate'
for a bit.

On the one hand,
Swiss Army Knife… knives?
Yeah, Swiss Army Knives.
vs, uh…
Octo… pus? -puses?
Octopods? - podes?
Octopi?

No that would require
a latin second declension,
and I think we're dealing with
a Greek third?

Fuck it, whatever.

On the surface,
both seem pretty cool --
but you're only gonna take one of them along
when you go camping.

Let's approach this logically.
Just the facts, please, everyone.

An octopus has 8 limbs.
An octopus with a Swiss Army Knife
has eight tools to choose from.
An octopus with eight Swiss Army Knives
has a eight tools _per limb_.
Each limb is basically sentient,
and now --
thanks to Victorinox --
each limb is _prepared for anything_!

Just like the Swiss.

And you might think it's hard to compare a
beloved multitool,
with a squishy boi who has 8 limbs?
I mean, don't you need both
the tool, and the limbs to use it?
Sure you do!
I get that.
I have nothing against an octopus --
unless it's trying to sell me
on some sketchy fortune-telling scam.

But we can still ask --
who's bringing more to the party?
And that's easy to answer.

Does the octopus make the knife better?
Not really.
Now you just have squishy
limbs in your pocket.

Does the knife make the octopus better?
Oh hell yeah.

Did American Soldiers in World War Two,
return home from the battlefield
with a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc,
turning it into an overnight sensation,
and a colloquial shorthand
for multi-tools?
No.

Does the Swiss Army
issue anyone an octopus,
or consider one essential for survival?
No.

Can an octopus
join the Swiss Army?
Fuck no.
Switzerland is landlocked.
Come on.
