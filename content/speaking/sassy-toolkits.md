**The web is littered with opinionated CSS frameworks**
that can rapidly back you into a corner.
Now pre-processors like Sass
have opened the door for more flexible toolkits,
and a thriving open-source community.
You don't need 3 million followers
and your own clearfix to contribute â€”
just a willingness to participate and learn.
Together, we can build more flexible and powerful toolkits
that respect our unique styles and constraints!
