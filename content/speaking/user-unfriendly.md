A project-manager’s reflections on human-centered problem-solving,
client communication,
and user feedback in agile web development.

The web is more than a technology platform,
it was created with a mission statement.
Design, code, and process trends also come with attached philosophies --
and they aren’t always friendly to the user.
We’ll talk about our human-centered approach to product-design,
transparent client communication,
learning to understand user-feedback,
and designing for edge-cases with integrated teams.

- An overview of the philosophy behind the web
- How the medium influences what we make, and how we work
- Understanding “open” and “opinionated” philosophies
- Understanding (and seeking-out) user-feedback, without sacrificing vision
- How we integrate developers and designers in tight feedback cycles
- How we talk to clients about design choices
