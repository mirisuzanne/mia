    This face is one of my special skills.
summary: |
  I'm an artist, activist,
  teacher, and web developer.
  As a co-founder of [OddBird](/orgs/oddbird/),
  [Teacup Gorilla](/orgs/teacup-gorilla/),
  and [Grapefruit Lab](/orgs/grapefruit-lab/)
  I hope to create art & software
  that celebrate the queer complexity
  of human experience.

Over the last 15 years
I've published novels & albums & technical manuals;
created award-winning theater & open-source tools;
cleaned my bedroom more than once;
and presented at conferences around the world --
but I've never been promoted at a job,
done a whiteboard interview,
or graduated from college.
