    Let's all get together in a big room
    so I can talk at you about code for an hour.
summary: |
  I'm an artist, activist,
  teacher, and web developer.
  As a co-founder of
  <a class="h-card p-org" href="/orgs/oddbird/">OddBird</a>,
  <a class="h-card p-org" href="/orgs/teacup-gorilla/">Teacup Gorilla</a>,
  and
  <a class="h-card p-org" href="/orgs/grapefruit-lab/">Grapefruit Lab</a>
  I hope to create art & software
  that celebrate the queerness & complexity
  of human experience.

Over the last 15 years
I've published novels & albums & technical manuals;
created award-winning theater & open-source tools;
cleaned my bedroom more than once;
and presented at conferences around the world --
but I've never been promoted at a job,
done a whiteboard interview,
or graduated from college.
