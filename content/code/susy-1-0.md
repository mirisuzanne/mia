Susy 1.0 has officially launched!
Thanks to everyone who contributed.

This release is loaded with new features,
but don't let that fool you.
Susy has become shockingly simple to use.
See the [website][susy] for more details and demonstrations.

The interface and syntax have been simplified
so that the language is consistent and easy to understand.
We cleaned up the output,
taking into account Compass browser-support settings,
and giving you more control over exactly how your grids are built.
Then we added a load of responsive tools
and optional new settings
to make Susy as absolutely flexible as possible.

Happy coding!
