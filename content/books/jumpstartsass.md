1. *Foreword* -- \
   by Chris Eppstein

   An introduction to Sass in modern front-end development,
   its history, its syntaxes (Sass and SCSS)
   as well as its competitors (LESS, Stylus and PostCSS).
3. *Getting Started* -- \
   A short explanation on how to install Sass binaries
   (both the Ruby gem and node-sass)
   and how to use them to compile Sass stylesheets to CSS.
4. *Variables* -- \
   An extensive chapter on variables, how they work,
   how to use them, when and why,
   closed with a comparison with CSS Custom Properties.
5. *Functions & Mixins* -- \
   A chapter dedicated to mastering functions and mixins
   to start building small systems.
6. *Loops & Conditions* -- \

   mostly focused on selector nesting,
   providing helpful tips to avoid being lost
   in the dreaded horizontal pyramid of selectors.
8. *Extend* -- \
   A solid introduction to the ``@extend`` directive
   and how to avoid bloated output when using it.
9. *Warnings & Errors* -- \
   An introduction to the ability to emit warnings

   as well as why and when doing so makes sense.
10.**Architecture* -- \
    A massive chapter on different approaches
    to Sass-powered project architecture,
    including OOCSS, ITCSS, SMACSS and more.
11.**Ecosystem* -- \
