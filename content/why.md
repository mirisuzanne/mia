{{ content.intro(summary) }}

That, to me, is beautiful.
All of us stumbling
through this wreckage ==and rubble together==,
finding beauty in the world
and in each other along the way.
Software that respects our opinions and autonomy;
collaborations that reflect back our diversity;
and art that gives us a venue to consider
{{ content.erase('the non-sense') }}
that remains —
what manifestos can never say.
Because understanding is not a pre-requisite ==for beauty==.

So I like narratives that are full of
holes and misdirection.
Bits borrowed from here and there,
fragments and remixes,
fused into a visceral barrage,
inviting you into an experience —
the start of ==a conversation==.
Diverse people breathing and sweating
and fighting and playing together.
Accidents, contradictions, and broken expectations.
Grasping at stability and form,
but always ==coming up short==.
