I'm overwhelmed by all the music! At this point I wander half-aimless,
in and out of venues — quick to judge, but more often inspired. Glad to
discover that most of my favorites are local, and I can stalk them like
a groupie until the next UMS arrives again.

I've always loved
[Accordion Crimes](http://accordion-crimes.blogspot.com/),
and they pulled through
again last night — full of dynamic surprise.
[Mako1972](http://mako1972.weebly.com/) has a similar post-punk thing
going, which I always enjoy. [Raven Jane](http://www.ravenjane.com/) and
[The Truth & Spectacle](http://thetruthandspectacle.com/) were excellent
(from our unbiased opinion of Daniel in a hat). I've followed [Ian
Cooke](http://www.iancookemusic.com/) for a while, and was glad to see
him returning to a simpler, cello-driven sound. Only caught the tail-end
of [StaG](http://stag.bandcamp.com/), but they earned another listen.
[Saturn Cowboys](http://saturncowboysmusic.com/) was a raucus fun time,
and [Dragondeer](http://dragondeer.com/) got the whole room (including
us) excited like no effect-heavy lead mandolin has ever done before.

This was a wonderful night of live/local music, but my favorite
discovery was the intricate shoegazing soundscapes of
[Dave Devine Relay](http://davedevine.com/relay).
